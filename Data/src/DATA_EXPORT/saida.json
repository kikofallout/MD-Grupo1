This situation deserves attention, given the close relationship between UPF and adverse health outcomes. This is due to the nutritional composition of UPF, which has high levels of health-critical nutrients such as sugar, fat, and sodium, thus compromising the overall quality of the diet. An excess of these nutrients can increase the risk of developing excess weight, nutritional deficiencies, and chronic diseases during childhood. Among the nutritional deficiencies is iron. This is due to the fact that UPF are not good sources of iron. This, combined with the fact that UPF is low in nutrients that help make iron more available, such as vitamin C, increases the risk of developing anemia. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the availability of iron, as well as the presence of anemia and excess weight in children living in situations of social vulnerability, and to determine their association with the consumption of UPF. This is a population-based cross-sectional study. Children aged between 6 and 59 months living in slums were included. The presence of excess weight was assessed by measuring weight and height, and the presence of anemia was determined by hemoglobin concentration, assessed using the HemoCue portable hemoglobinometer. A 24-h food recall was also used to assess the relative calorie intake of UFP and the dietary availability of iron using an algorithm. All statistical analyses were carried out using the statistical software Jamovi.

Understanding the factors influencing these behaviors is crucial for crafting effective public health strategies. The objective was to analyze young Poles' eating habits, their perceptions of health, and the role of various determinants in shaping these behaviors. A survey was conducted among a representative sample of young Poles, gathering data on eating habits, health perceptions, and lifestyle choices. The survey focused on the respondents' understanding of healthy eating, sources of nutrition knowledge, and the influence of family, social media, and public health campaigns. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and correlations between health behaviors and socio-demographic factors were examined. The study revealed that 88% of young respondents prioritize health, with 73% acknowledging a link between nutrition and health. While most participants accurately described healthy eating and reported adherence to dietary guidelines, 43% engaged in emotional eating, which often led to compulsive behaviors associated with obesity. Social media, internet articles, and family were primary sources of nutrition knowledge. Despite their knowledge, fruit and vegetable consumption was below recommended levels, and physical activity levels were insufficient in nearly half of the respondents.

The plans are currently paper-based and become outdated as soon as a patient's health status changes. There is a need to digitize these plans to improve their accessibility, modifiability, and longevity. With current technology, SCPs can be linked to mobile devices and activity trackers so that patients can track health behaviors and compare them to their clinical goals, taking charge of their own health.<h4>Objective</h4>A mobile app, POSTHOC (POST-Treatment Health Outcomes of Cancer Survivors), that digitizes the SCP was developed, with goals of integrating it with wearable technologies and electronic medical records.

Statistical analyses were performed to explore gender-specific differences.<h4>Results</h4>Based on the PCA, five distinct groups of participants were identified: Balanced Eaters, Focused on Home Cooking, Routine Eaters, Restaurant Lovers and Varied Eaters. Significant gender differences in food preferences were observed, with men consuming more meat and women more vegetables. Men also reported greater participation in strength and endurance sports, while women showed a more structured eating routine.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study, using principal component analysis (PCA), revealed gender-specific patterns in diet, physical activity and body composition. PCA identified five distinct behavioural groups, revealing that men tended to consume more meat and engage in strength training, while women adhered to structured, vegetable-rich diets. The application of PCA provided more insight than traditional analysis, highlighting the complexity of gender-specific behaviour.

Guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), this integrative review aimed to synthesize studies examining how personal and household characteristics, caregivers' dietary beliefs, intentions, and feeding practices influence the eating behaviors of preschool-aged children (2-5 years).<h4>Methods</h4>PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles published between January 2014 and September 2024. The expanded PRISMA 2020 checklist was used to guide the literature search and report the results. The Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-Based Practice (JHNEBP) was also used to evaluate the quality of the selected articles.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 10 studies were included in the final analysis. The studies revealed that preschoolers' eating behaviors were significantly influenced by personal characteristics (e.g., caregivers' BMI, and weight perceptions) and household factors (e.g., food availability). Additionally, caregivers' feeding practices, such as restriction, modeling, and permissiveness, played a pivotal role in shaping children's eating habits. Although caregivers expressed intentions to provide a healthy diet, they often faced barriers, including conflicting work schedules, financial constraints, and logistical challenges, which impeded their ability to consistently promote healthy eating behaviors.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Caregivers' beliefs, intentions, and feeding practices are pivotal in shaping preschoolers' eating behaviors.

The term \"coconut\" (or the archaic \"cocoanut\") can refer to the whole coconut palm, the seed, or the fruit, which botanically is a drupe, not a nut.  They are ubiquitous in coastal tropical regions and are a cultural icon of the tropics.\nThe coconut tree provides food, fuel, cosmetics, folk medicine and building materials, among many other uses. The inner flesh of the mature seed, as well as the coconut milk extracted from it, forms a regular part of the diets of many people in the tropics and subtropics. Coconuts are distinct from other fruits because their endosperm contains a large quantity of an almost clear liquid, called \"coconut water\" or \"coconut juice\". Mature, ripe coconuts can be used as edible seeds, or processed for oil and plant milk from the flesh, charcoal from the hard shell, and coir from the fibrous husk. Dried coconut flesh is called copra, and the oil and milk derived from it are commonly used in cooking \u2013 frying in particular \u2013 as well as in soaps and cosmetics. Sweet coconut sap can be made into drinks or fermented into palm wine or coconut vinegar. The hard shells, fibrous husks and long pinnate leaves can be used as material to make a variety of products for furnishing and decoration.\nThe coconut has cultural and religious significance in certain societies, particularly in the Austronesian cultures of the Western Pacific where it is featured in their mythologies, songs, and oral traditions.

These behaviors may include eating either too much or too little. Types of eating disorders include binge eating disorder, where the patient keeps eating large amounts in a short period of time typically while not being hungry; anorexia nervosa, where the person has an intense fear of gaining weight and restricts food or overexercises to manage this fear; bulimia nervosa, where individuals eat a large quantity (binging) then try to rid themselves of the food (purging); pica, where the patient eats non-food items; rumination syndrome, where the patient regurgitates undigested or minimally digested food; avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), where people have a reduced or selective food intake due to some psychological reasons; and a group of other specified feeding or eating disorders. Anxiety disorders, depression and substance abuse are common among people with eating disorders. These disorders do not include obesity. People often experience comorbidity between an eating disorder and OCD. It is estimated 20\u201360% of patients with an ED have a history of OCD.\nThe causes of eating disorders are not clear, although both biological and environmental factors appear to play a role. Cultural idealization of thinness is believed to contribute to some eating disorders. Individuals who have experienced sexual abuse are also more likely to develop eating disorders. Some disorders such as pica and rumination disorder occur more often in people with intellectual disabilities.\nTreatment can be effective for many eating disorders. Treatment varies by disorder and may involve counseling, dietary advice, reducing excessive exercise, and the reduction of efforts to eliminate food. Medications may be used to help with some of the associated symptoms. Hospitalization may be needed in more serious cases. About 70% of people with anorexia and 50% of people with bulimia recover within five years. Only 10% of people with eating disorders receive treatment, and of those, approximately 80% do not receive the proper care. Many are sent home weeks earlier than the recommended stay and are not provided with the necessary treatment. Recovery from binge eating disorder is less clear and estimated at 20% to 60%. Both anorexia and bulimia increase the risk of death. When people experience comorbidity with an eating disorder and OCD, certain aspects of treatment can be negatively impacted. OCD can make it harder to recover from obsession over weight and shape, body dissatisfaction, and body checking. This is in part because ED cognitions serve a similar purpose to OCD obsessions and compulsions (e.g., safety behaviors as temporary relief from anxiety).

The symptoms of the allergic reaction may range from mild to severe. They may include itchiness, swelling of the tongue, vomiting, diarrhea, hives, trouble breathing, or low blood pressure. This typically occurs within minutes to several hours of exposure. When the symptoms are severe, it is known as anaphylaxis. A food intolerance and food poisoning are separate conditions, not due to an immune response.\nCommon foods involved include cow's milk, peanuts, eggs, shellfish, fish, tree nuts, soy, wheat, and sesame. The common allergies vary depending on the country. Risk factors include a family history of allergies, vitamin D deficiency, obesity, and high levels of cleanliness. Allergies occur when immunoglobulin E (IgE), part of the body's immune system, binds to food molecules. A protein in the food is usually the problem.

It is the main anabolic hormone of the body. It regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and protein by promoting the absorption of glucose from the blood into cells of the liver, fat, and skeletal muscles.  In these tissues the absorbed glucose is converted into either glycogen, via glycogenesis, or fats (triglycerides), via lipogenesis; in the liver, glucose is converted into both. Glucose production and secretion by the liver are strongly inhibited by high concentrations of insulin in the blood. Circulating insulin also affects the synthesis of proteins in a wide variety of tissues. It is thus an anabolic hormone, promoting the conversion of small molecules in the blood into large molecules in the cells. Low insulin in the blood has the opposite effect, promoting widespread catabolism, especially of reserve body fat.\nBeta cells are sensitive to blood sugar levels so that they secrete insulin into the blood in response to high level of glucose, and inhibit secretion of insulin when glucose levels are low. Insulin production is also regulated by glucose: high glucose promotes insulin production while low glucose levels lead to lower production. Insulin enhances glucose uptake and metabolism in the cells, thereby reducing blood sugar. Their neighboring alpha cells, by taking their cues from the beta cells, secrete glucagon into the blood in the opposite manner: increased secretion when blood glucose is low, and decreased secretion when glucose concentrations are high. Glucagon increases blood glucose by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver. The secretion of insulin and glucagon into the blood in response to the blood glucose concentration is the primary mechanism of glucose homeostasis.\nDecreased or absent insulin activity results in diabetes, a condition of high blood sugar level (hyperglycaemia). There are two types of the disease. In type 1 diabetes, the beta cells are destroyed by an autoimmune reaction so that insulin can no longer be synthesized or be secreted into the blood. In type 2 diabetes, the destruction of beta cells is less pronounced than in type 1, and is not due to an autoimmune process. Instead, there is an accumulation of amyloid in the pancreatic islets, which likely disrupts their anatomy and physiology. The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes is not well understood but reduced population of islet beta-cells, reduced secretory function of islet beta-cells that survive, and peripheral tissue insulin resistance are known to be involved. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by increased glucagon secretion which is unaffected by, and unresponsive to the concentration of blood glucose.

Ketoacidosis is most commonly the result of complete insulin deficiency in type 1 diabetes or late-stage type 2 diabetes.", "Ketone levels can be measured in blood, urine or breath and are generally between 0.5 and 3.0 millimolar (mM) in physiological ketosis, while ketoacidosis may cause blood concentrations greater than 10 mM.  Trace levels of ketones are always present in the blood and increase when blood glucose reserves are low and the liver shifts from primarily metabolizing carbohydrates to metabolizing fatty acids. This occurs during states of increased fatty acid oxidation such as fasting, starvation, carbohydrate restriction, or prolonged exercise.", "When the liver rapidly metabolizes fatty acids into acetyl-CoA, some acetyl-CoA molecules can then be converted into ketone bodies: pyruvate, acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone. These ketone bodies can function as an energy source as well as signalling molecules. The liver itself cannot utilize these molecules for energy, so the ketone bodies are released into the blood for use by peripheral tissues including the brain.  When ketosis is induced by carbohydrate restriction, it is sometimes referred to as nutritional ketosis. A low-carbohydrate, moderate protein diet that can lead to ketosis is called a ketogenic diet.", "Ketosis is well-established as a treatment for epilepsy and is also effective in treating type 2 diabetes."], "topic": "diabetes", "hierarchical_level": 3, "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketosis"}

Humans vary in the amount of lactose they can tolerate before symptoms develop. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, flatulence, and nausea. These symptoms typically start thirty minutes to two hours after eating or drinking something containing lactose, with the severity typically depending on the amount consumed. Lactose intolerance does not cause damage to the gastrointestinal tract.\nLactose intolerance is due to the lack of the enzyme lactase in the small intestines to break lactose down into glucose and galactose. There are four types: primary, secondary, developmental, and congenital. Primary lactose intolerance occurs as the amount of lactase declines as people grow up. Secondary lactose intolerance is due to injury to the small intestine. Such injury could be the result of infection, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or other diseases. Developmental lactose intolerance may occur in premature babies and usually improves over a short period of time. Congenital lactose intolerance is an extremely rare genetic disorder in which little or no lactase is made from birth. The reduction of lactase production starts typically in late childhood or early adulthood, but prevalence increases with age.\nDiagnosis may be confirmed if symptoms resolve following eliminating lactose from the diet. Other supporting tests include a hydrogen breath test and a stool acidity test. Other conditions that may produce similar symptoms include irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. Lactose intolerance is different from a milk allergy. Management is typically by decreasing the amount of lactose in the diet, taking lactase supplements, or treating the underlying disease.

Its discovery in 1958 by Aaron B. Lerner and colleagues stemmed from the isolation of a substance from the pineal gland of cows that could induce skin lightening in common frogs. This compound was later identified as a hormone secreted in the brain during the night, playing a crucial role in regulating the sleep-wake cycle, also known as the circadian rhythm, in vertebrates.\nIn vertebrates, melatonin's functions extend to synchronizing sleep-wake cycles, encompassing sleep-wake timing and blood pressure regulation, as well as controlling seasonal rhythmicity (circannual cycle), which includes reproduction, fattening, molting, and hibernation.

The name \"noradrenaline\" (from Latin ad, \"near\", and ren, \"kidney\") is more commonly used in the United Kingdom and the rest of the world, whereas \"norepinephrine\" (from Ancient Greek \u1f10\u03c0\u1fd0\u0301 (ep\u00ed), \"upon\", and \u03bd\u03b5\u03c6\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 (nephr\u00f3s), \"kidney\") is usually preferred in the United States. \"Norepinephrine\" is also the international nonproprietary name given to the drug. Regardless of which name is used for the substance itself, parts of the body that produce or are affected by it are referred to as noradrenergic.\nThe general function of norepinephrine is to mobilize the brain and body for action. Norepinephrine release is lowest during sleep, rises during wakefulness, and reaches much higher levels during situations of stress or danger, in the so-called fight-or-flight response. In the brain, norepinephrine increases arousal and alertness, promotes vigilance, enhances formation and retrieval of memory, and focuses attention; it also increases restlessness and anxiety. In the rest of the body, norepinephrine increases heart rate and blood pressure, triggers the release of glucose from energy stores, increases blood flow to skeletal muscle, reduces blood flow to the gastrointestinal system, and inhibits voiding of the bladder and gastrointestinal motility.\nIn the brain, noradrenaline is produced in nuclei that are small yet exert powerful effects on other brain areas. The most important of these nuclei is the locus coeruleus, located in the pons. Outside the brain, norepinephrine is used as a neurotransmitter by sympathetic ganglia located near the spinal cord or in the abdomen, as well as Merkel cells located in the skin. It is also released directly into the bloodstream by the adrenal glands. Regardless of how and where it is released, norepinephrine acts on target cells by binding to and activating adrenergic receptors located on the cell surface.\nA variety of medically important drugs work by altering the actions of noradrenaline systems. Noradrenaline itself is widely used as an injectable drug for the treatment of critically low blood pressure. Stimulants often increase, enhance, or otherwise act as agonists of norepinephrine.

Regardless of which name is used for the substance itself, parts of the body that produce or are affected by it are referred to as noradrenergic. The general function of norepinephrine is to mobilize the brain and body for action. Norepinephrine release is lowest during sleep, rises during wakefulness, and reaches much higher levels during situations of stress or danger, in the so-called fight-or-flight response.", "In the brain, norepinephrine increases arousal and alertness, promotes vigilance, enhances formation and retrieval of memory, and focuses attention; it also increases restlessness and anxiety. In the rest of the body, norepinephrine increases heart rate and blood pressure, triggers the release of glucose from energy stores, increases blood flow to skeletal muscle, reduces blood flow to the gastrointestinal system, and inhibits voiding of the bladder and gastrointestinal motility.  In the brain, noradrenaline is produced in nuclei that are small yet exert powerful effects on other brain areas. The most important of these nuclei is the locus coeruleus, located in the pons.", "Outside the brain, norepinephrine is used as a neurotransmitter by sympathetic ganglia located near the spinal cord or in the abdomen, as well as Merkel cells located in the skin. It is also released directly into the bloodstream by the adrenal glands. Regardless of how and where it is released, norepinephrine acts on target cells by binding to and activating adrenergic receptors located on the cell surface.

They are widely distributed in nature, are important constituents of animal lipid metabolism, and play an important role in the human diet and in human physiology. The three types of omega\u22123 fatty acids involved in human physiology are \u03b1-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). ALA can be found in plants, while DHA and EPA are found in algae and fish. Marine algae and phytoplankton are primary sources of omega\u22123 fatty acids. DHA and EPA accumulate in fish that eat these algae. Common sources of plant oils containing ALA include walnuts, edible seeds, and flaxseeds as well as hempseed oil, while sources of EPA and DHA include fish and fish oils, and algae oil.\nAlmost without exception, animals are unable to synthesize the essential omega\u22123 fatty acid ALA and can only obtain it through diet. However, they can use ALA, when available, to form EPA and DHA, by creating additional double bonds along its carbon chain (desaturation) and extending it (elongation). Namely, ALA (18 carbons and 3 double bonds) is used to make EPA (20 carbons and 5 double bonds), which is then used to make DHA (22 carbons and 6 double bonds).

Pasta was originally only made with durum, although the definition has been expanded to include alternatives for a gluten-free diet, such as rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils. Pasta is believed to have developed independently in Italy and is a staple food of Italian cuisine, with evidence of Etruscans making pasta as early as 400 BCE in Italy.\nPastas are divided into two broad categories: dried (Italian: pasta secca) and fresh (Italian: pasta fresca). Most dried pasta is produced commercially via an extrusion process, although it can be produced at home. Fresh pasta is traditionally produced by hand, sometimes with the aid of simple machines.

", "In 2020 Simpson and Raubenheimer published the popular science book Eat Like the Animals: What Nature Teaches Us about the Science of Healthy Eating, which details their experiments. For lifelong health they recommend eating a balanced diet with more fiber and fewer fats and carbohydrates rather than an extremely high protein diet.  In 1995, Australian researcher Susanna Holt developed the concept of satiety value, a measure of how much a given food is likely to satisfy the hunger of someone. High protein foods have been found to have high satiety values, though these are outmatched by potatoes and oats (which have a low glycemic index).", "Fruits rank similarly to high protein foods (likely due to their high level of dietary fibre). == References =="], "topic": "obesity", "hierarchical_level": 3, "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_leverage_hypothesis"}

Whether it\u2019s carry-out, food court, ofce cafeteria \nor sit-down restaurant , there are smart choices everywhere. Here are 31 tips to help you eat \nhealthy when ordering out.  1.\nThink ahead and plan where you will eat. Consider what meal options are\navailable. Look for places with a wide range of menu items.  2.\nTake time to look over the menu and make careful selections.", "Some\nrestaurant menus may have a special section for \u201chealthier\u201d choices.  3.\nReview and compare nutrition information if it\u2019s available. Menu\nterms that may indicate an item is healthier include: baked, braised,\nbroiled, grilled, poached, roasted, and steamed. 4.\nMenu terms that usually mean a food is higher in saturated fat and\ncalories include: batter-fried, pan-fried, buttered, creamed, crispy,\nbreaded. Choose these foods only occasionally and in small portions.  5.\nThink about your food choices for the entire day. If you\u2019re planning a\nspecial restaurant meal in the evening, have a light breakfast and lunch. ", "6.\nHold the bread or chips until your meal is served. Hunger may drive you\nto fll up on these foods before your meal arrives.  7.\nLimit the amount of alcohol you drink. No more than one drink for\nwomen and two for men. Alcohol tends to increase your appetite and\nprovides calories without any nutrients.  8.\nOrder the regular or child-size portion. Mega-sized servings\nare probably more than you need. For a lighter meal, order an\nappetizer in place of a main course.  9.\nBegin with soup or salad as a way to include more vegetables at mealtime.\nFollow up with a light main course.  10. Or choose a salad with grilled chicken or seafood as your main course.  11.", "It\u2019s OK to make special requests, just keep them simple. For example, ask for a baked potato or side\nsalad in place of French fries; no mayonnaise or bacon on your sandwich; sauces served on the side.  12. Ask for sauces, dressings and toppings to be served \u201con the side.\u201dThen you control how much you eat\n13. Split your order. Share an extra large sandwich or main course with a friend or take half home for\nanother meal (some restaurants may not permit this or will charge for an extra plate).\n14. Refrigerate carry-out or leftovers if the food\nwon\u2019t be eaten right away.", "Toss foods kept at\nroom temperature for more than two hours\n(one hour if warmer than 90 degrees).\n15. All-you-can-eat specials, bufets and\nunlimited salad bars make it difcult to follow\nrecommended serving sizes. Pass these up if\nyou fnd it difcult to listen to your hunger cues.\n16. If you do choose the bufet, fll up on salads and\nvegetables frst. Use small plates, to encourage\nsmaller portions, and limit your trips up to the bufet line .  17. At the salad bar, pile on the dark leafy greens,\ncarrots, peppers and other fresh vegetables. ", "Lighten up on mayonnaise-based salads\nand high-fat toppings. Enjoy fresh fruit as\nyour dessert. 18. Load up your pizza with vegetable toppings. If you add meat, make it lean ham, Canadian\nbacon, chicken or shrimp.  19. Enjoy a variety of healthful foods from diferent\ncultures. Focus on dishes that emphasize\nvegetables and lean meats, seafood or beans.  20. Tempted by sweet, creamy desserts? Order a\nsmall portion or ask if it can be divided and\nshared with everyone at the table.  21. At the sandwich shop, choose lean beef, ham,\nturkey or chicken on whole grain bread. Ask for\nmustard, ketchup, salsa or low-fat spreads.", "And,\ndon\u2019t forget the veggies. 22. Boost the nutrition in all types of sandwiches\nby adding tomato, lettuce, peppers or\nother vegetables.  23. Look for a sandwich wrap in a soft tortilla. Fillings such as rice mixed with seafood,\nchicken, or grilled vegetables can be\nhealthier options.  24. In place of fries or chips, choose a side salad,\nfruit or baked potato. Or, share a regular order\nof fries with a friend.  25. Build a better breakfast sandwich: replace\nbacon or sausage with Canadian bacon or ham\nand order your sandwich on a whole grain\nEnglish mufn or bagel.  26.", "Be size-wise about mufns, bagels, croissants\nand biscuits. A jumbo mufn has more than\ntwice the calories of the regular size. 27. Try a smoothie made with 100% juice, fruit and\nlow-fat yogurt for a light meal or snack.  28. For desk-top dining, keep single-serve\npackages of whole grain crackers, fruit, peanut\nbutter, soup, or tuna around for a quick lunch.  29. Food items on your desk, like nuts or candy bowls,\ncan lead to mindless eating. Keep all snacks\nand other food items in your desk to avoid the\ntemptation to eat when you\u2019re not hungry.  30.", "Grabbing dinner at the supermarket deli?  Select rotisserie chicken, salad-in-a-bag and\nfreshly baked bread. Or, try sliced lean roast\nbeef, onion rolls, salad and fresh fruit.  31. Always eating on the go? Tuck portable,\nnonperishable foods in your purse, tote,\nbriefcase or backpack for an on-the-run meal.  Some suggestions are peanut butter and\ncrackers, granola bars, a piece of fresh fruit, trail\nmix, single serve packages of whole grain cereal.\nFor a referral to a registered dietitian nutritionist \nand for additional food and nutrition \ninformation, visit eatright.org.", "The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics is the world\u2019s \nlargest organization of food and nutrition professionals.

guidelines executive summary the foods and beverages that people consume have a profound impact on their health the scientific connection between food and health has been well documented for many decades with substantial and increasingly robust evidence showing that a healthy lifestyleincluding following a healthy dietary pattern can help people achieve and maintain good health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases throughout all stages of the lifespan infancy and toddlerhood childhood and adolescence adulthood pregnancy and lactation and older adulthood the core elements of a healthy dietary pattern are remarkably consistent across the lifespan and across health outcomes since the first edition was published in 1980 the dietary guidelines for americans have provided sciencebased advice on what to eat and drink to promote health reduce risk of chronic disease and meet nutrient needs publication of the dietary guidelines is required under the 1990 national nutrition monitoring and related research act which states that at least every 5 years the us departments of agriculture usda and of health and human services hhs must jointly publish a report containing nutritional and dietary information and guidelines for the general public the statute public law 101445 7 united states code 5341 et seq requires that the dietary guidelines be based on the preponderance of current scientific and medical knowledge the 20202025 edition of the dietary guidelines builds from the 2015 edition with revisions grounded in the scientific report of the 2020 dietary guidelines advisory committee and consideration of federal agency and public comments the dietary guidelines is designed for policymakers and nutrition and health professionals to help all individuals and their families consume a healthy nutritionally adequate diet the information in the dietary guidelines is used to develop implement and evaluate federal food nutrition and health policies dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 executive summary page 2 and programs it also is the basis for federal nutrition education materials designed for the public and for the nutrition education components of usda and hhs nutrition programs state and local governments schools the food industry other businesses community groups and media also use dietary guidelines information to develop programs policies and communication for the general public the aim of the dietary guidelines is to promote health and prevent disease because of this public health orientation the dietary guidelines is not intended to contain clinical guidelines for treating chronic diseases chronic diseases result from a complex mix of genetic biological behavioral socioeconomic and environmental factors and people with these conditions have unique health care requirements that require careful oversight by a health professional the body of scientific evidence on diet and health reviewed to inform the dietary guidelines is representative of the us populationit includes people who are healthy people at risk for dietrelated chronic conditions and diseases such as cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes and obesity and some people who are living with one or more of these dietrelated chronic illnesses at the same time it is essential that federal agencies medical organizations and health professionals adapt the dietary guidelines to meet the specific needs of their patients as part of an individual multifaceted treatment plan for the specific chronic disease consistent and evolving although many recommendations have remained relatively consistent over time the dietary guidelines also has built upon previous editions and evolved as scientific knowledge has grown the dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 reflects this in three important ways the first is its recognition that dietrelated chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes obesity and some types of cancer are very prevalent among americans and pose a major public health problem today more than half of adults have one or more dietrelated chronic diseases as a result recent editions of the dietary guidelines have focused on healthy individuals as well as those with overweight or obesity and those who are at risk of chronic disease a fundamental premise of the 2020 2025 dietary guidelines is that just about everyone no matter their health status can benefit from shifting food and beverage choices to better support healthy dietary patterns the second is its focus on dietary patterns researchers and public health experts including registered dietitians understand that nutrients and foods are not consumed in isolation rather people consume them in various combinations over timea dietary patternand these foods and beverages act synergistically to affect health the dietary guidelines for americans 20152020 puts this understanding into action by focusing its recommendations on consuming a healthy dietary pattern the 20202025 dietary guidelines carries forward this emphasis on the importance of a healthy dietary pattern as a whole rather than on individual nutrients foods or food groups in isolation the third is its focus on a lifespan approach this edition of the dietary guidelines highlights the importance of encouraging healthy dietary patterns at every life stage from infancy through older adulthood it provides recommendations for healthy dietary patterns by life stage identifying needs specific to each life stage and considering healthy dietary pattern characteristics that should be carried forward into the next stage of life for the first time since the 1985 edition the 2020 2025 dietary guidelines includes recommendations for healthy dietary patterns for infants and toddlers the guidelines the 20202025 dietary guidelines provides four overarching guidelines that encourage healthy eating patterns at each stage of life and recognize that individuals will need to make shifts in their food and beverage choices to achieve a healthy pattern the guidelines also explicitly emphasize that a healthy dietary pattern is not a rigid prescription rather the guidelines are a customizable framework of core elements within which individuals make tailored and affordable choices that meet their personal cultural and traditional preferences several examples of healthy dietary patterns that translate and integrate the recommendations in overall healthy ways to eat are provided the guidelines are supported by key recommendations that provide further guidance on healthy eating across the lifespan page 3 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 executive summary the guidelines make every bite count with the dietary guidelines for americans heres how at every life stageinfancy toddlerhood childhood adolescence adulthood pregnancy lactation and older adulthoodit is never too early or too late to eat healthfully for about the first 6 months of life exclusively feed infants human milk continue to feed infants human milk through at least the first year of life and longer if desired feed infants ironfortified infant formula during the first year of life when human milk is unavailable provide infants with supplemental vitamin d beginning soon after birth at about 6 months introduce infants to nutrientdense complementary foods introduce infants to potentially allergenic foods along with other complementary foods encourage infants and toddlers to consume a variety of foods from all food groups include foods rich in iron and zinc particularly for infants fed human milk from 12 months through older adulthood follow a healthy dietary pattern across the lifespan to meet nutrient needs help achieve a healthy body weight and reduce the risk of chronic disease 1 2 follow a healthy dietary pattern at every life stage customize and enjoy nutrientdense food and beverage choices to reflect personal preferences cultural traditions and budgetary considerations a healthy dietary pattern can benefit all individuals regardless of age race or ethnicity or current health status the dietary guidelines provides a framework intended to be customized to individual needs and preferences as well as the foodways of the diverse cultures in the united states 3 focus on meeting food group needs with nutrientdense foods and beverages and stay within calorie limits an underlying premise of the dietary guidelines is that nutritional needs should be met primarily from foods and beveragesspecifically nutrientdense foods and beverages nutrientdense foods provide vitamins minerals and other healthpromoting components and have no or little added sugars saturated fat and sodium a healthy dietary pattern consists of nutrientdense forms of foods and beverages across all food groups in recommended amounts and within calorie limits the core elements that make up a healthy dietary pattern include vegetables of all typesdark green red and orange beans peas and lentils starchy and other vegetables fruits especially whole fruit grains at least half of which are whole grain dairy including fatfree or lowfat milk yogurt and cheese andor lactosefree versions and fortified soy beverages and yogurt as alternatives protein foods including lean meats poultry and eggs seafood beans peas and lentils and nuts seeds and soy products oils including vegetable oils and oils in food such as seafood and nuts dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 executive summary page 4 4 limit foods and beverages higher in added sugars saturated fat and sodium and limit alcoholic beverages at every life stage meeting food group recommendationseven with nutrientdense choicesrequires most of a persons daily calorie needs and sodium limits a healthy dietary pattern doesnt have much room for extra added sugars saturated fat or sodiumor for alcoholic beverages a small amount of added sugars saturated fat or sodium can be added to nutrientdense foods and beverages to help meet food group recommendations but foods and beverages high in these components should be limited limits are added sugarsless than 10 percent of calories per day starting at age 2 avoid foods and beverages with added sugars for those younger than age 2 saturated fatless than 10 percent of calories per day starting at age 2 sodiumless than 2300 milligrams per dayand even less for children younger than age 14 alcoholic beveragesadults of legal drinking age can choose not to drink or to drink in moderation by limiting intake to 2 drinks or less in a day for men and 1 drink or less in a day for women when alcohol is consumed drinking less is better for health than drinking more there are some adults who should not drink alcohol such as women who are pregnant for most individuals no matter their age or health status achieving a healthy dietary pattern will require changes in food and beverage choices some of these changes can be accomplished by making simple substitutions while others will require greater effort to accomplish this edition of the dietary guidelines presents overall guidance on choosing nutrientdense foods and beverages in place of less healthy choices and also discusses special nutrition considerations for individuals at each life stageinfants and toddlers children and adolescents adults women who are pregnant or lactating and older adults although individuals ultimately decide what and how much to consume their personal relationships the settings in which they live learn work play and gather and other contextual factorsincluding their ability to consistently access healthy and affordable foodstrongly influence their choices health professionals communities businesses and industries organizations government and other segments of society all have a role to play in supporting individuals and families in making choices that align with the dietary guidelines and ensuring that all people have access to a healthy and affordable food supply resources including federal programs that support households regardless of size and makeup in choosing a healthy diet and improving access to healthy food are highlighted throughout this edition of the dietary guidelines for americans terms to know several terms are used throughout the dietary guidelines and are essential to understanding the guidelines and putting them into action these terms are defined here dietary pattern it is the combination of foods and beverages that constitutes an individuals complete dietary intake over time this may be a description of a customary way of eating or a description of a combination of foods recommended for consumption nutrient dense nutrientdense foods and beverages provide vitamins minerals and other healthpromoting components and have little added sugars saturated fat and sodium vegetables fruits whole grains seafood eggs beans peas and lentils unsalted nuts and seeds fatfree and lowfat dairy products and lean meats and poultrywhen prepared with no or little added sugars saturated fat and sodium are nutrientdense foods"], "topic": "nutrition", "hierarchical_level": 5, "link": ""}

to present the dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 this edition marks the first time the guidelines provide recommendations by life stage from birth through older adulthood each stage of life is distinct and has unique needs that affect health and disease risk early food preferences influence food and beverage choices later and the science has evolved to focus on the importance of a healthy dietary pattern over time the science also shows its never too late to start and maintain a healthy dietary pattern which can yield health benefits in the short term and cumulatively over years this new edition of the dietary guidelines includes specific recommendations for all life stages now including infants and toddlers and pregnant and lactating women we are excited this is the first edition to provide guidance for every life stage this edition of the dietary guidelines is grounded in robust scientific reviews of the current body of evidence on key nutrition and health topics for each life stage we thank the 20 distinguished scientists on the 2020 dietary guidelines advisory committee for their expertise and dedication in conducting an independent scientific review that was characterized by more transparency and public participation throughout the process than ever before the committees work culminated in a comprehensive scientific report on the current state of nutrition science and provided advice to the departments for our development of this 9th edition of the dietary guidelines the committee also included important considerations for future research such as a need to reconsider the dietary reference intakes the us and canadian dietary reference intake steering committees are currently developing plans to reexamine energy protein fat and carbohydratethe timeline for these macronutrient reviews has not been established usda and hhs are looking forward to jointly funding the work to help guide our departments research agendas in the coming years with the science must come practicethat is making food and beverage choices that align with the dietary guidelines using the new edition of the dietary guidelines we hope americans can find ways to start simple and incorporate modest changes each day that push americans closer to meeting the recommendations its more important than ever to make healthy eating a priority in the united states with the release of the dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 we have an important call to action for you as health professionals and policymakers we are asking you to help the public make every bite count with the dietary guidelines for americans help people make food and beverage choices that are rich in nutritionindividual choices that can become a healthy routine over time choices they can enjoy in good health for many years to come thank you for all you do to help americans make strides toward aligning closer to the dietary guidelines as we all work together to help the public

a profound impact on their health the scientific connection between food and health has been well documented for many decades with substantial and increasingly robust evidence showing that a healthy lifestyleincluding following a healthy dietary pattern can help people achieve and maintain good health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases throughout all stages of the lifespan infancy and toddlerhood childhood and adolescence adulthood pregnancy and lactation and older adulthood the core elements of a healthy dietary pattern are remarkably consistent across the lifespan and across health outcomes since the first edition was published in 1980 the dietary guidelines for americans have provided sciencebased advice on what to eat and drink to promote health reduce risk of chronic disease and meet nutrient needs publication of the dietary guidelines is required under the 1990 national nutrition monitoring and related research act which states that at least every 5 years the us departments of agriculture usda and of health and human services hhs must jointly publish a report containing nutritional and dietary information and guidelines for the general public the statute public law 101445 7 united states code 5341 et seq requires that the dietary guidelines be based on the preponderance of current scientific and medical knowledge the 20202025 edition of the dietary guidelines builds from the 2015 edition with revisions grounded in the scientific report of the 2020 dietary guidelines advisory committee and consideration of federal agency and public comments the dietary guidelines is designed for policymakers and nutrition and health professionals to help all individuals and their families consume a healthy nutritionally adequate diet the information in the dietary guidelines is used to develop implement and evaluate federal food nutrition and health policies dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 executive summary page viii and programs it also is the basis for federal nutrition education materials designed for the public and for the nutrition education components of usda and hhs nutrition programs state and local governments schools the food industry other businesses community groups and media also use dietary guidelines information to develop programs policies and communication for the general public the aim of the dietary guidelines is to promote health and prevent disease because of this public health orientation the dietary guidelines is not intended to contain clinical guidelines for treating chronic diseases chronic diseases result from a complex mix of genetic biological behavioral socioeconomic and environmental factors and people with these conditions have unique health care requirements that require careful oversight by a health professional the body of scientific evidence on diet and health reviewed to inform the dietary guidelines is representative of the us populationit includes people who are healthy people at risk for dietrelated chronic conditions and diseases such as cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes and obesity and some people who are living with one or more of these dietrelated chronic illnesses at the same time it is essential that federal agencies medical organizations and health professionals adapt the dietary guidelines to meet the specific needs of their patients as part of an individual multifaceted treatment plan for the specific chronic disease consistent and evolving although many recommendations have remained relatively consistent over time the dietary guidelines also has built upon previous editions and evolved as scientific knowledge has grown the dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 reflects this in three important ways the first is its recognition that dietrelated chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes obesity and some types of cancer are very prevalent among americans and pose a major public health problem today more than half of adults have one or more dietrelated chronic diseases as a result recent editions of the dietary guidelines have focused on healthy individuals as well as those with overweight or obesity and those who are at risk of chronic disease a fundamental premise of the 2020 2025 dietary guidelines is that just about everyone no matter their health status can benefit from shifting food and beverage choices to better support healthy dietary patterns the second is its focus on dietary patterns researchers and public health experts including registered dietitians understand that nutrients and foods are not consumed in isolation rather people consume them in various combinations over timea dietary patternand these foods and beverages act synergistically to affect health the dietary guidelines for americans 20152020 puts this understanding into action by focusing its recommendations on consuming a healthy dietary pattern the 20202025 dietary guidelines carries forward this emphasis on the importance of a healthy dietary pattern as a whole rather than on individual nutrients foods or food groups in isolation the third is its focus on a lifespan approach this edition of the dietary guidelines highlights the importance of encouraging healthy dietary patterns at every life stage from infancy through older adulthood it provides recommendations for healthy dietary patterns by life stage identifying needs specific to each life stage and considering healthy dietary pattern characteristics that should be carried forward into the next stage of life for the first time since the 1985 edition the 2020 2025 dietary guidelines includes recommendations for healthy dietary patterns for infants and toddlers the guidelines the 20202025 dietary guidelines provides four overarching guidelines that encourage healthy eating patterns at each stage of life and recognize that individuals will need to make shifts in their food and beverage choices to achieve a healthy pattern the guidelines also explicitly emphasize that a healthy dietary pattern is not a rigid prescription rather the guidelines are a customizable framework of core elements within which individuals make tailored and affordable choices that meet their personal cultural and traditional preferences several examples of healthy dietary patterns that translate and integrate the recommendations in overall healthy ways to eat are provided the guidelines are supported by key recommendations that provide further guidance on healthy eating across the lifespan page ix dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 executive summary the guidelines make every bite count with the dietary guidelines for americans heres how 1 2 3 follow a healthy dietary pattern at every life stage at every life stageinfancy toddlerhood childhood adolescence adulthood pregnancy lactation and older adulthoodit is never too early or too late to eat healthfully for about the first 6 months of life exclusively feed infants human milk continue to feed infants human milk through at least the first year of life and longer if desired feed infants ironfortified infant formula during the first year of life when human milk is unavailable provide infants with supplemental vitamin d beginning soon after birth at about 6 months introduce infants to nutrientdense complementary foods introduce infants to potentially allergenic foods along with other complementary foods encourage infants and toddlers to consume a variety of foods from all food groups include foods rich in iron and zinc particularly for infants fed human milk from 12 months through older adulthood follow a healthy dietary pattern across the lifespan to meet nutrient needs help achieve a healthy body weight and reduce the risk of chronic disease customize and enjoy nutrientdense food and beverage choices to reflect personal preferences cultural traditions and budgetary considerations a healthy dietary pattern can benefit all individuals regardless of age race or ethnicity or current health status the dietary guidelines provides a framework intended to be customized to individual needs and preferences as well as the foodways of the diverse cultures in the united states focus on meeting food group needs with nutrientdense foods and beverages and stay within calorie limits an underlying premise of the dietary guidelines is that nutritional needs should be met primarily from foods and beveragesspecifically nutrientdense foods and beverages nutrientdense foods provide vitamins minerals and other healthpromoting components and have no or little added sugars saturated fat and sodium a healthy dietary pattern consists of nutrientdense forms of foods and beverages across all food groups in recommended amounts and within calorie limits the core elements that make up a healthy dietary pattern include vegetables of all typesdark green red and orange beans peas and lentils starchy and other vegetables fruits especially whole fruit grains at least half of which are whole grain dairy including fatfree or lowfat milk yogurt and cheese andor lactosefree versions and fortified soy beverages and yogurt as alternatives protein foods including lean meats poultry and eggs seafood beans peas and lentils and nuts seeds and soy products oils including vegetable oils and oils in food such as seafood and nuts dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 executive summary page x 4 limit foods and beverages higher in added sugars saturated fat and sodium and limit alcoholic beverages at every life stage meeting food group recommendationseven with nutrientdense choicesrequires most of a persons daily calorie needs and sodium limits a healthy dietary pattern doesnt have much room for extra added sugars saturated fat or sodiumor for alcoholic beverages a small amount of added sugars saturated fat or sodium can be added to nutrientdense foods and beverages to help meet food group recommendations but foods and beverages high in these components should be limited limits are added sugarsless than 10 percent of calories per day starting at age 2 avoid foods and beverages with added sugars for those younger than age 2 saturated fatless than 10 percent of calories per day starting at age 2 sodiumless than 2300 milligrams per dayand even less for children younger than age 14 alcoholic beveragesadults of legal drinking age can choose not to drink or to drink in moderation by limiting intake to 2 drinks or less in a day for men and 1 drink or less in a day for women when alcohol is consumed drinking less is better for health than drinking more there are some adults who should not drink alcohol such as women who are pregnant for most individuals no matter their age or health status achieving a healthy dietary pattern will require changes in food and beverage choices some of these changes can be accomplished by making simple substitutions while others will require greater effort to accomplish this edition of the dietary guidelines presents overall guidance on choosing nutrientdense foods and beverages in place of less healthy choices and also discusses special nutrition considerations for individuals at each life stageinfants and toddlers children and adolescents adults women who are pregnant or lactating and older adults although individuals ultimately decide what and how much to consume their personal relationships the settings in which they live learn work play and gather and other contextual factorsincluding their ability to consistently access healthy and affordable foodstrongly influence their choices health professionals communities businesses and industries organizations government and other segments of society all have a role to play in supporting individuals and families in making choices that align with the dietary guidelines and ensuring that all people have access to a healthy and affordable food supply resources including federal programs that support households regardless of size and makeup in choosing a healthy diet and improving access to healthy food are highlighted throughout this edition of the dietary guidelines for americans terms to know several terms are used throughout the dietary guidelines and are essential to understanding the guidelines and putting them into action these terms are defined here dietary pattern it is the combination of foods and beverages that constitutes an individuals complete dietary intake over time this may be a description of a customary way of eating or a description of a combination of foods recommended for consumption nutrient dense nutrientdense foods and beverages provide vitamins minerals and other healthpromoting components and have little added sugars saturated fat and sodium vegetables fruits whole grains seafood eggs beans peas and lentils unsalted nuts and seeds fatfree and lowfat dairy products and lean meats and poultrywhen prepared with no or little added sugars saturated fat and sodium are nutrientdense foods page 1 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 introduction dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 introduction page 2 introduction dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 introduction page 2 page 3 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 introduction setting the stage t he foods and beverages that people consume have a profound impact on their health the scientific connection between food and health has been well documented for many decades with substantial evidence showing that healthy dietary patterns can help people achieve and maintain good health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases throughout all stages of the lifespan yet federal data show that from the first edition of the dietary guidelines for americans in 1980 through today americans have fallen far short of meeting its recommendations and dietrelated chronic disease rates have risen to pervasive levels and continue to be a major public health concern the dietary guidelines is an important part of a complex multifaceted approach to promote health and reduce chronic disease risk the dietary guidelines provides sciencebased advice on what to eat and drink to promote health help reduce risk of chronic disease and meet nutrient needs the dietary guidelines is the foundation of federal food nutrition and health policies and programs an important audience is health professionals and nutrition program administrators who work with the general public to help them consume a healthy and nutritionally adequate diet and establish policies and services to support these efforts comprehensive coordinated strategies built on the sciencebased foundation of the dietary guidelinesand a commitment to drive these strategies over time across sectors and settingscan help all americans consume healthy dietary patterns achieve and maintain good health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases grounded in science and focused on public health the us departments of agriculture usda and of health and human services hhs update the dietary guidelines at least every 5 years based on the current science a fundamental premise of the dietary guidelines is that everyone no matter their age race or ethnicity economic circumstances or health status can benefit from shifting food and beverage choices to better support healthy dietary patterns dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 introduction page 4 to make sure that the dietary advice provided in the dietary guidelines is aimed at improving public health the science used to inform the guidelines has examined diet through a lens of health promotion and disease prevention and considered various segments of the united states population including ethnic populations who have disproportionately andor historically been affected by dietrelated disparities this means that priority has been placed on scientific studies that examine the relationship between diet and health across all life stages in men women and children from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds who are healthy or at risk of chronic disease over time eating patterns in the united states have remained far below dietary guidelines recommendations figure i1 concurrently it has become increasingly clear that dietrelated chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes obesity liver disease some types of cancer and dental caries pose a major public health problem for americans today 60 percent of adults have one or more dietrelated chronic diseases table i1 given its aim to prevent further disease incidence by promoting health and reducing chronic disease risk the dietary guidelines focuses on the general public including healthy individuals as well as those with overweight or obesity and those who are at risk of chronic disease the importance of following the dietary guidelines across all life stages has been brought into focus even more with the emergence of covid19 as people living with dietrelated chronic conditions and diseases are at an increased risk of severe illness from the novel coronavirus grounded in the current body of scientific evidence on diet and health that is relevant to all americans the dietary guidelines is a critically important tool for health professionals policymakers and many other professionals it is designed to help people make food and beverage choices all through life that are enjoyable and affordable and that also promote health and help prevent chronic disease figure i1 adherence of the us population to the dietary

spotlight on dietary patterns although many of its recommendations have remained relatively consistent over time the dietary guidelines has evolved as scientific knowledge has grown early dietary guidelines editions used evidence that examined the relationships between individual nutrients foods and food groups and health outcomes in recent years researchers public health experts and registered dietitians have acknowledged that nutrients and foods are not consumed in isolation rather people consume them in various combinations over timea dietary patternand these foods and beverages act synergistically to affect health the 20152020 dietary guidelines put this understanding into action by focusing its recommendations on consuming a healthy dietary pattern the 20202025 dietary guidelines carries forward this emphasis on the importance of a healthy dietary pattern as a whole rather than on individual nutrients or foods in isolation serving as a framework the guidelines dietary patterns approach enables policymakers programs and health professionals to help people personalize their food and beverage choices to accommodate their wants and needs food preferences cultural traditions and customs and budgetary considerations healthy dietary patterns at every life stage the 20202025 dietary guidelines takes the dietary patterns approach one step further by focusing on the importance of encouraging healthy dietary patterns at every stage of life from birth to older adulthood it provides recommendations for healthy dietary patterns by life stage identifying needs specific to each life stage and considering healthy dietary pattern characteristics that should be carried forward into the next stage of life and for the first time since the 1985 edition this edition of the dietary guidelines includes recommendations for infants and toddlers as well as continuing the emphasis on healthy dietary patterns during pregnancy and lactation this approach recognizes that each life stage is distinctnutrient needs vary over the lifespan and each life stage has unique implications for food and beverage choices and disease risk at the same time it recognizes an important continuity because early food preferences influence later food choices establishing a healthy dietary pattern early in life may have a beneficial impact on health promotion and disease prevention over the course of decades page 7 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 introduction dietary guidelines for americans what it is what it is not the dietary guidelines translates the current science on diet and health into guidance to help people choose foods and beverages that comprise a healthy and enjoyable dietary patternthe what and how much of foods and beverages to consume to achieve good health reduce risk of dietrelated chronic diseases and meet nutrient needs the dietary guidelines is just one piece of the nutrition guidance landscape however other guidance is designed to address requirements for the specific nutrients contained in foods and beverages or to address treatments for individuals who have a chronic disease the following section describes the role of the dietary guidelines within this larger nutrition guidance landscape quantitative guidance on foods not nutrient requirements nutrient requirements are established and updated by the national academies of sciences engineering and medicine at the request of the us and canadian federal governments the academies set the quantitative requirements or limitsknown as dietary reference intakes drion nutrients which include macronutrients ie protein carbohydrates and fats vitamins and minerals eg vitamin c iron and sodium and food components eg dietary fiber because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods thus the dietary guidelines translates the academies nutrient requirements into food and beverage recommendations the dietary guidelines recognizes though that in some cases fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients eg during specific life stages such as pregnancy health promotion not disease treatment at its core the dietary guidelines has a public health missionthat is health promotion and disease prevention medical and nutrition professionals may use or adapt the dietary guidelines to encourage their patients or clients to follow a healthy dietary pattern the body of current scientific evidence on diet and health reviewed to inform the dietary guidelines included study participants who represent the us population including healthy individuals and people at risk of dietrelated chronic conditions and diseases such as cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes or obesity and some people who are living with a diet related chronic illness because of this public health orientation the dietary guidelines is not intended to be a clinical guideline for treating chronic diseases however the dietary guidelines often has served as a reference for federal medical voluntary and patient care organizations as they develop clinical nutrition guidance tailored for people living with a specific medical condition chronic diseases result from a complex mix of genetic biological behavioral socioeconomic and environmental factors and people with these conditions have unique health care requirements that require careful oversight by a health professional health professionals can adapt the dietary guidelines to meet the specific needs of their patients with chronic diseases as part of a multifaceted treatment plan developing the dietary guidelines for americans the process to develop the dietary guidelines has evolved over time in step with developments in nutrition science public health and best practices in scientific review and guidance development usda and hhs work together to determine the approach for each edition as stipulated by law usda and hhs must update the dietary guidelines at least every 5 years the guidelines must be grounded in the body of scientific and medical knowledge available at that time not in individual studies or individual expert opinion in establishing the process for the 20202025 dietary guidelines usda and hhs considered and integrated recommendations from a comprehensive 2017 national academies study review of the process to update the dietary guidelines greater transparency figured prominently in the academies recommendations as a result in developing the 20202025 process usda and hhs made significant changes to increase transparency and public participation while maintaining the core element of scientific integrity one of these changes was the addition of a new stage at the beginning of the process thus the 20202025 process consisted of four stages 1 identify the topics dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 introduction page 8 stage 1 identify topics and supporting scientific questions stage 2 appoint a dietary guidelines advisory committee to review evidence stage 3 develop the dietary guidelines stage 4 implement the dietary guidelines and supporting scientific questions to be examined 2 appoint a dietary guidelines advisory committee to review current scientific evidence 3 develop the new edition of the dietary guidelines and 4 implement the dietary guidelines through federal programs the following information provides an overview of the 4stage process more details are available at dietaryguidelinesgov stage 1 identify topics and supporting scientific questions the departments added a new step of identifying topics and scientific questions to begin the process of developing the next dietary guidelines this was done to promote a deliberate and transparent process better define the expertise needed on the committee and ensure the scientific review conducted by the committee would address federal nutrition policy and program needs and help manage resources in consultation with agencies across the federal government usda and hhs identified potential topics and supporting scientific questions that were of greatest importance and relevance to federal nutrition programs policies and consumer education priorities compared to all previous dietary guidelines processes the topic areas for 20202025 expanded due to the added focus on infants and toddlers from birth through age 23 months as well as women who are pregnant the agricultural act of 2014 mandated that beginning with the 20202025 edition the dietary guidelines should expand to include dietary guidance for these populations thus the topics and questionsand areas of expertise needed on the committeereflected this change the departments posted the topics and questions publicly on dietaryguidelinesgov allowing the public and federal agencies 30 days to view and provide comments following review of the comments usda and hhs posted the final topics and questions along with the public call for nominations to the 2020 committee having topics and questions identified upfront helped inform the publics nominations by defining which areas of nutrition expertise were needed on the committee stage 2 appoint a dietary guidelines advisory committee to review current scientific evidence in the second stage the secretaries of usda and hhs appointed the committee with the single timelimited task of reviewing the 20152020 dietary guidelines examining the evidence on the selected nutrition and public health topics and scientific questions and providing independent sciencebased advice and recommendations to usda and hhs the 20 nationally recognized scientific experts appointed to the committee represented a mix of practitioners epidemiologists scientists clinical trialists and others from every region of the united states the use of a federal advisory committee is a commonly used best practice to ensure the federal government seeks sound external scientific advice to inform decisions the committees work concluded with its scientific report submitted to the secretaries of usda and hhs in june 20201 this report was not a draft of the dietary guidelines it was a scientific document that detailed the committees evidence review and provided advice to usda and hhs the committee was divided into six subcommittees to conduct its work dietary patterns pregnancy and lactation birth to age 24 months beverages and added sugars dietary fats and seafood and frequency 1 dietary guidelines advisory committee 2020 scientific report of the 2020 dietary guidelines advisory committee advisory report to the secretary of agriculture and the secretary of health and human services us department of agriculture agricultural research service washington dc page 9 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 introduction of eating the committee also formed one crosscutting working groupdata analysis and food pattern modeling to support work across the subcommittees the committees work had three defining characteristics the use of three approaches to examine the evidence the creation of transparent protocols before the evidence review began and the development of scientific review conclusion statements for the scientific reviews conducted three approaches to examine the evidence the 2020 committee used three stateoftheart approaches to conduct its robust and rigorous reviews data analysis using federal nationally representative data this approach provided insights into current eating habits of the us population and current dietrelated chronic disease rates in the united states these data helped make the dietary guidelines practical relevant and achievable the committee used data analysis to address scientific questions that looked at current dietary patterns and beverage consumption current intakes of food groups and nutrients dietary components of public health concern prevalence of nutritionrelated chronic health conditions and relationships between eating habits and achieving nutrient and food group recommendations nutrition evidence systematic review nesr systematic reviews are research projects that follow meticulously defined protocols ie plans to answer clearly formulated scientific questions by searching for evaluating and synthesizing all relevant peerreviewed studies systematic reviews are considered a gold standard method to inform development of evidencebased guidelines by ensuring consideration of the strongest most appropriate body of evidence available on a topic usdas nutrition evidence systematic review is a team of scientists who specializes in conducting systematic reviews focused on nutrition and disease prevention and evaluating scientific evidence on nutrition topics relevant to federal policy and programs nesr used its rigorous protocoldriven methodology to support the committee in conducting its systematic reviews new to the 2020 process usda and hhs added a step for peer review of the systematic reviews by federal scientists food pattern modeling this type of analysis illustrates how changes to the amounts or types of foods and beverages in a dietary pattern might affect meeting nutrient needs across the us population the committee used this method to assess potential changes to the usda dietary patterns which help meet the dris set by the national academies while taking into consideration current consumption in the united states and the conclusions from its systematic reviews as with all food pattern modeling for the dietary guidelines the results of the committees food pattern modeling tests were interpreted in light of two key assumptions first the modeling tests were based on nutrient profiles of nutrientdense foods in the us food supply and us populationbased dietary data populationbased patterns articulate the evidence on the relationships between diet and health in ways that might be adopted by the us public as a whole second modeling tests assumed populationwide compliance with all food intake recommendations as with other types of modeling the food pattern modeling is hypothetical and does not predict the behaviors of individuals each of these approaches had its own rigorous protocoldriven methodology and each had a unique complementary role in examining the science additional detailed information is available at dietaryguidelinesgov and nesrusdagov dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 introduction page 10 transparent protocols first then review to answer each scientific question the committee first created a protocol that described how the committee would apply one of the three approaches to examine the evidence related to that specific question the committee created each protocol before examining any evidence and for the first time the protocols were posted online for the public as they were being developed this enabled the public to understand how a specific scientific question would be answered and to have the opportunity to submit public comments before the committee completed the protocols and conducted its reviews of the scientific evidence detailed information on the committees review is documented in its scientific report which is available on dietaryguidelinesgov health status of participants in studies included in nutrition evidence systematic reviews to ensure that the dietary guidelines promotes the health of and reduce risk of disease among all americans the evidence base that informs the dietary guidelines must comprise studies conducted with people who are representative of the general public and must examine diet through a health promotion and disease prevention lens as outlined in the committees systematic review protocols the committees reviews included studies with participants who were healthy and or who were at risk of a chronic disease including participants with obesity as well as studies that enrolled some participants with a disease because the dietary guidelines is not intended to be a clinical guideline for treating chronic diseases the committee excluded studies that enrolled only patients with a disease with the intention to treat those individuals in general the majority of the reviews conducted to inform the dietary guidelines included trials that exclusively enrolled participants with overweight or obesity or who were at high risk of cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes and observational studies that enrolled participants from a wide range of health and weight status including those with healthy weight overweight or obesity the reviews included few studies that enrolled only healthy participants thus the dietary guidelines are applicable to the overall us population including healthy individuals and people at risk of dietrelated chronic conditions and diseases such as cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes and obesity in addition people living with a diet related chronic illness can benefit from a healthy dietary pattern the dietary guidelines can serve as a reference for federal medical voluntary and patient care organizations as they develop nutrition guidance tailored for people living with a specific medical condition health professionals can adapt the dietary guidelines to meet the specific needs of their patients with chronic diseases as part of a multifaceted treatment plan page 11 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 introduction conclusion statements for the scientific reviews conducted for all topics and questions regardless of the approach used to identify and evaluate the scientific evidence the committee developed conclusion statements each conclusion statement provided a succinct answer to the specific question posed the committee took the strengths and limitations of the evidence base into consideration when formulating conclusion statements for questions answered using nesr systematic reviews the conclusion statements included a grade to indicate the strength of the evidence supporting the conclusion statement the grades were strong moderate limited or grade not assignable grading the strength of the evidence applied only to questions answered using nesr systematic reviews it did not apply to questions answered using data analysis or food pattern modeling therefore data analysis and food pattern modeling conclusion statements were not graded as it completed its work the committee looked across all of the conclusion statements to develop overarching advice for usda and hhs to consider as the departments developed the next edition of the dietary guidelines using these three approaches the committee worked collaboratively for 16 months and deliberated on the scientific reviews in six meetings all of which were open to the public two of the six meetings included an opportunity for the public to provide oral comments to the committee an ongoing period for written public comments to the committee spanned 15 months of its work and for the first time a final public meeting was included for the committee to discuss its draft scientific report 1 month before the final report was posted for public comment in addition to documenting its rigorous review of the evidence to answer the scientific questions from usda and hhs and providing advice for the departments development of the next dietary guidelines edition the committee provided recommendations for future research these research recommendations reflected an acknowledgment that science in nutrition diet and health associations continues to evolve and that new findings build on and enhance existing evidence upon submitting its final scientific report to the usda and hhs secretaries the committee disbanded the departments then posted the scientific report and asked the public for comments the departments received written comments on the report over a 30day period and also held an online meeting to hear oral comments stage 3 develop the dietary guidelines each edition of the dietary guidelines builds on the preceding edition with the scientific justification for revisions informed by the committees scientific report and consideration of public and federal agency comments as with previous editions development of the 20202025 dietary guidelines involved a stepby step process of writing review and revision conducted by a writing team of federal staff from usda and hhs dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 introduction page 12 the writing team included federal nutrition scientists with expertise in the dietary guidelines and related research and programs as well as specialists with expertise in communicating nutrition information key tenets of writing the dietary guidelines are that it must represent the totality of the evidence examined address the needs of federal programs reduce unintended consequences follow best practices for developing guidelines use plain language the draft dietary guidelines went through internal and external review ultimately the document was reviewed by all agencies with nutrition policies and programs across usda and hhs such as usdas food and nutrition service and its food safety and inspection service and hhs national institutes of health food and drug administration and centers for disease control and prevention the draft dietary guidelines also went through an external expert peer review to ensure that it accurately reflected the body of evidence documented in the committees scientific report this process culminated with approval by the secretaries of usda and hhs after approval by the secretaries the departments released the dietary guidelines to federal agencies and the public for implementation across programs and through educational activities stage 4 implement the dietary guidelines the us government uses the dietary guidelines as the basis of its food assistance and meal programs nutrition education efforts and decisions about national health objectives for example the national school lunch program and the older americans act nutrition program incorporate the dietary guidelines in menu planning the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children applies the dietary guidelines in its program and educational materials and the healthy people objectives for the nation include objectives based on the dietary guidelines the dietary guidelines also provides a critical structure for state and local public health promotion and disease prevention initiatives in addition it provides foundational evidencebased nutrition guidance for use by individuals and those who serve them in public and private settings including health professionals public health and social service agencies health care and educational institutions researchers agricultural producers food and beverage manufacturers and more page 13 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 introduction using myplate as a guide to support healthy dietary patterns implementation of the dietary guidelines through myplate the dietary guidelines for americans is developed and written for a professional audience therefore its translation into actionable consumer messages and resources is crucial to help individuals families and communities achieve healthy dietary patterns myplate is one example of consumer translation created to be used in various settings and adaptable to meeting personal preferences cultural foodways traditions and budget needs myplate is used by professionals across sectors to help people become more aware of and informed about making healthy food and beverage choices over time more information is available at myplategov following a healthy dietary pattern from birth through older adulthood can have a profound impact on a persons lifelong health the dietary guidelines provides the framework for following such a pattern however broad and multisector collaboration is needed to help people achieve that goal action on many fronts is needed to ensure that healthy dietary choices at home school work and play are the affordable accessible norm everyone has a role to play in helping all americans shift to a healthy dietary pattern and achieve better health try the myplate plan a healthy eating routine is important at every stage of life and can have positive effects that add up over time its important to eat a variety of fruits vegetables grains dairy or fortified soy alternatives and protein foods

20202025 reflecting the accumulating body of evidence about the relationships between diet and health outcomes the 20202025 dietary guidelines presents its recommendations with a primary emphasis on encouraging the consumption of a healthy overall dietary pattern at every stage of life from birth through older adulthood this edition of the dietary guidelines consists of an executive summary this introduction six chapters and three appendixes chapter 1 nutrition and health across the lifespan the guidelines and key recommendations discusses the health benefits of lifelong healthy dietary choices and explains the four guidelines and supporting key recommendations this chapter is the basis for all the succeeding chapters chapters 2 through 6 should be read in tandem with chapter 1 chapter 2 infants and toddlers is the first of five chapters that focus on healthy dietary patterns for a specific life stage this edition of the dietary guidelines is the first since the 1985 edition to provide guidance for infants and toddlers birth through age 23 months the chapter provides specific key recommendations for this age group along with guidance on how to put these recommendations into action the chapter closes with a healthy dietary pattern during the second year of life and a look toward the next life stage children and adolescents chapter 3 children and adolescents first sets the stage by describing nutrition issues specific to children and adolescents ages 2 through 18 it then presents the recommended healthy dietary patterns for this age group explains how current intakes compare to recommendations and discusses special dietary guidance considerations for this life stage the chapter concludes with a discussion of ways to support healthy dietary patterns among children and adolescents and a look toward the next life stageadults chapter 4 adults opens with a discussion of selected nutrition issues that characterize the adult life stage ages 19 through 59 it then presents the recommended healthy dietary patterns for this age group explains how current intakes compare to recommendations and discusses special dietary guidance considerations for adults the chapter concludes with suggestions for how to support healthy dietary patterns among adults and a look toward two important adult life stageswomen who are pregnant or lactating and older adults

first year of life and longer if desired feed infants ironfortified infant formula during the first year of life when human milk is unavailable provide infants with supplemental vitamin d beginning soon after birth at about 6 months introduce infants to nutrientdense complementary foods introduce infants to potentially allergenic foods along with other complementary foods encourage infants and toddlers to consume a variety of foods from all food groups include foods rich in iron and zinc particularly for infants fed human milk from 12 months through older adulthood follow a healthy dietary pattern across the lifespan to meet nutrient needs help achieve a healthy body weight and reduce the risk of chronic disease customize and enjoy nutrient dense food and beverage choices to reflect personal preferences cultural traditions and budgetary considerations a healthy dietary pattern can benefit all individuals regardless of age race or ethnicity or current health status the dietary guidelines provides a framework intended to be customized to individual needs and preferences as well as the foodways of the diverse cultures in the united states focus on meeting food group needs with nutrientdense foods and beverages and stay within calorie limits an underlying premise of the dietary guidelines is that nutritional needs should be met primarily from foods and beveragesspecifically nutrientdense foods and beverages nutrientdense foods provide vitamins minerals and other healthpromoting components and have no or little added sugars saturated fat and sodium a healthy dietary pattern consists of nutrientdense forms of foods and beverages across all food groups in recommended amounts and within calorie limits the core elements that make up a healthy dietary pattern include vegetables of all typesdark green red and orange beans peas and lentils starchy and other vegetables fruits especially whole fruit grains at least half of which are whole grain dairy including fatfree or lowfat milk yogurt and cheese andor lactosefree versions and fortified soy beverages and yogurt as alternatives protein foods including lean meats poultry and eggs seafood beans peas and lentils and nuts seeds and soy products oils including vegetable oils and oils in food such as seafood and nuts limit foods and beverages higher in added sugars saturated fat and sodium and limit alcoholic beverages at every life stage meeting food group recommendationseven with nutrient dense choicesrequires most of a persons daily calorie needs and sodium limits a healthy dietary pattern doesnt have much room for extra added sugars saturated fat or sodiumor for alcoholic beverages a small amount of added sugars saturated fat or sodium can be added to nutrientdense foods and beverages to help meet food group recommendations but foods and beverages high in these components should be limited limits are added sugarsless than 10 percent of calories per day starting at age 2 avoid foods and beverages with added sugars for those younger than age 2 saturated fatless than 10 percent of calories per day starting at age 2 sodiumless than 2300 milligrams per dayand even less for children younger than age 14 alcoholic beveragesadults of legal drinking age can choose not to drink or to drink in moderation by limiting intake to 2 drinks or less in a day for men and 1 drink or less in a day for women when alcohol is consumed drinking less is better for health than drinking more there are some adults who should not drink alcohol such as women who are pregnant 3 guideline guideline 2 4 guideline page 19 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 1 nutrition and health across the lifespan 1 if not specified explicitly references to foods refer to foods and beverages a fundamental premise of the dietary guidelines is that almost everyone no matter an individuals age race or ethnicity or health status can benefit from shifting food and beverage choices to better support healthy dietary patterns healthy eating starts at birth with the exclusive consumption of human milk if possible for about the first 6 months if human milk is unavailable infants should be fed an ironfortified commercial infant formula ie labeled with iron regulated by the us food and drug administration fda which are based on standards that ensure nutrient content and safety healthy eating continues with the introduction of complementary foods and beverages at about 6 months of age by 12 months infants should maintain their healthy eating as they transition to developmentally appropriate foods and beverages healthy eating continues in each life stage thereafter even though nutrient needs vary across life stages the foods and beverages that individuals should eat over the lifespan are remarkably consistent this chapter provides foundational guidance about maintaining a healthy dietary pattern across each life stageinfancy toddlerhood childhood adolescence adulthood pregnancy lactation and older adulthood because the nutritional needs and transition of infants and toddlers are unique chapter 2 provides a focused discussion on this age group chapters 3 4 5 and 6 then provide tailored nutrition information specific to children and adolescents adults women who are pregnant or lactating and older adults respectively what is a dietary pattern over the course of any given day week or year individuals consume foods and beverages1 in combinationa dietary pattern a dietary pattern represents the totality of what individuals habitually eat and drink and the parts of the pattern act synergistically to affect health as a result the dietary pattern may better predict overall health status and disease risk than individual foods or nutrients a healthy dietary pattern consists of nutrientdense forms of foods and beverages across all food groups in recommended amounts and within calorie limits achieving a healthy dietary pattern at each life stage not only supports health at that point in time but also supports health in the next life stage and possibly for future generations if healthy dietary patterns can be established early in life and sustained thereafter the impact on health could be significant establishing and maintaining a healthy dietary pattern can help minimize dietrelated chronic disease risk conversely consuming foods and beverages that are not nutrient dense may lead to disease expression in later years high intakes of such foods ie an unhealthy dietary pattern throughout the lifespan can increase the risk of developing chronic diseases the good news is that at any stage of life individuals can make efforts to adopt a healthy dietary pattern and improve their health the healthy usstyle dietary pattern usdas primary dietary pattern provides a framework for healthy eating that all americans can follow it is based on the types and proportions of foods americans of all ages genders races and ethnicities typically consume but in nutrientdense forms and appropriate amounts the healthy usstyle dietary pattern is carried forward from the 20152020 dietary guidelines for americans the 2000calorie level of the pattern is shown in table 11 the healthy mediterraneanstyle dietary pattern and the healthy vegetarian dietary pattern also carried forward from the 20152020 dietary guidelines for americansare variations of the healthy usstyle dietary pattern that have the same core elements the usda dietary patterns are described in appendix 3 usda dietary patterns and are meant to be tailored to meet cultural and personal preferences and used as guides to plan and serve meals for individuals households and in a variety of institutions and other settings the dietary approaches to stop hypertension dash dietary pattern

dietary pattern science is the foundation of the dietary guidelines recommendations on what americans should eat and drink to promote health reduce risk of chronic disease and meet nutrient needs the science shows that consuming a healthy dietary pattern meeting food group and nutrient needs with nutrientdense foods and beverages and limiting intake of foods and beverages that are not nutrientdense is related to many health benefits science also supports the idea that every life stage provides an opportunity to make food choices that promote health and wellbeing achieve and maintain appropriate weight status and reduce risk of dietrelated chronic disease the science supporting the dietary guidelines is extensively documented in the scientific report of the 2020 dietary guidelines advisory committee which describes the state of the science on key topics related to diet and health outcomes with strong or moderate evidence are provided in figure 13 the report is available at dietaryguidelinesgov evidence on the association between dietary patterns and reduced risk of dietrelated chronic diseases has expanded in recent years and supports the use of dietary patterns as a foundation for the recommendations in the dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 consistent evidence demonstrates that a healthy dietary pattern is associated with beneficial outcomes for allcause mortality cardiovascular disease overweight and obesity type 2 diabetes bone health and certain types of cancer breast and colorectal common characteristics of dietary patterns associated with positive health outcomes include relatively higher intake of vegetables fruits legumes whole grains low or nonfat dairy lean meats and poultry seafood nuts and unsaturated vegetable oils and relatively lower consumption of red and processed meats sugarsweetened foods and beverages and refined grains the evidence examined showed broad representation across a number of populations and demographic groups this suggests a consistent association no matter the region or cultural context in which a healthy dietary pattern is consumed in addition dietary patterns characterized by higher intake of red and processed meats sugarsweetened foods and beverages and refined grains are in and of themselves associated with detrimental health outcomes these findings are consistent withand build onthe evidence base that informed the 2015 2020 dietary guidelines a healthy dietary pattern supports appropriate calorie levels the total number of calories a person needs each day varies depending on a number of factors namely the persons age sex height weight level of physical activity and pregnancy or lactation status due to reductions in basal metabolic rate that occur with aging calorie needs generally decrease for adults as they age in addition a need to lose maintain or gain weight affects how many calories should be consumed estimated amounts of calories needed based on age sex and level of physical activity are provided in appendix 2 estimated calorie needs and estimated calorie needs relevant for different ages are provided in each life stage chapter these estimates are based on the estimated energy requirement eer equations established by the national academies of sciences engineering and medicine national academies using reference heights average and reference weights healthy for each agesex group these amounts are estimates the best way to evaluate calorie intake in comparison to calorie needs is by measuring body weight status rather than focus on weight status at any one point in life the dietary guidelines supports healthy weight trajectories at each stage of lifeappropriate weight gain during pregnancy and postpartum weight loss healthy growth and development from infancy through adolescence weight stability during midlife and healthy body composition late in life meeting the dietary guidelines recommendations within calorie needs can help prevent excess weight gain at every life stage and support overall good health 1 guideline dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 1 nutrition and health across the lifespan page 24 1

20202025 chapter 1 nutrition and health across the lifespan key dietary principles to help people meet the guidelines and key recommendations the following are important principles when making decisions about nutrient dense food and beverage choices to achieve a healthy dietary pattern meet nutritional needs primarily from foods and beverages the dietary guidelines are designed to meet the recommended dietary allowances and adequate intakes for essential nutrients as well as acceptable macronutrient distribution ranges all set by the national academies an underlying premise of the dietary guidelines is that nutritional needs should be met primarily from foods and beverages specifically nutrientdense foods and beverages in some cases when meeting nutrient needs is not otherwise possible fortified foods and nutrientcontaining dietary supplements are useful it is important to note that the nutrient density and healthfulness of what people eat and drink often is determined ultimately by how a food item dish or meal is prepared at home and away from home or produced by a manufacturer based on the us food supply and marketplace the examples of healthy dietary patterns in this edition are achievable through thoughtful informed choices one decision one meal one day at a timeand consistently over time choose a variety of options from each food group enjoy different foods and beverages within each food group this can help meet nutrient needsand also allows for flexibility so that the dietary guidelines can be tailored to meet cultural and personal preferences all forms of foods including fresh canned dried frozen and 100 juices in nutrientdense forms can be included in healthy dietary patterns pay attention to portion size portion size is a term often used to describe the amount of a food or beverage served or consumed in one eating occasion it is important to pay attention to portion size when making food and beverage choices particularly for foods and beverages that are not nutrientdense a concept that can help people choose appropriate portions is serving size this term is included on the nutrition facts label and refers to the amount of a food or beverage that is customarily consumedit is not a recommendation of how much to eat or drink consuming less than the stated serving size results in consuming fewer calories and other nutrients or food components some products may have multiple servings per package 1 guideline dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 1 nutrition and health across the lifespan page 26 most americans do not follow a healthy dietary pattern the typical dietary patterns currently consumed by many in the united states do not align with the dietary guidelines figure 14 the healthy eating index hei is a measure of diet quality that can be used to assess compliance with the dietary guidelines for americans ages 2 and older hei2015 scores indicate that intakes are not consistent with recommendations for a healthy dietary pattern average diet quality has slightly improved in the past 10 years but the average score of 59 on a scale from 0 to 100 indicates that people have much room for improvement differences in overall hei scores are seen across age sex raceethnic and income subgroups and by pregnancy and lactation status though poor diet quality is observed across all groups with each step closer to a diet that aligns with the core elements of a healthy dietary pattern hei scores will increase and risk for chronic disease will decrease figure 14 adherence of the us population to the

with overweight or obesity suggests that many people in the united states consume foods and beverages that contribute to a calorie imbalance a situation more likely to occur with low physical activity as shown in the introduction table i1 74 percent of all adults and 40 percent of all children and youth in the united states have either overweight or obesity even from the youngest ages almost all americans should shift to healthier food and beverage choices and consume smaller portions to achieve a healthy dietary pattern within an appropriate number of calories it is never too early or too late to improve intake and establish a healthy dietary pattern page 27 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 1 nutrition and health across the lifespan guideline 2 customize and enjoy food and beverage choices to reflect personal preferences cultural traditions and budgetary considerations eating should be enjoyed and a healthy dietary pattern can be enjoyable from early life to older adulthood the science reviewed to inform the dietary guidelines represents the diversity of americans including all ages and life stages different racial and ethnic backgrounds and a range of socioeconomic statuses a healthy dietary pattern can benefit all individuals regardless of age race or ethnicity or current health status the dietary guidelines provides a framework intended to be customized to fit individual household and federal program participants preferences as well as the foodways of the diverse cultures in the united states the us population is diverse in myriad ways the dietary guidelines framework purposely provides recommendations by food groups and subgroupsnot specific foods and beveragesto avoid being prescriptive this framework approach ensures that people can make it their own by selecting healthy foods beverages meals and snacks specific to their needs and preferences the food groups include a broad variety of nutrientdense food and beverage choices in every setting across all cultures and at any age or budget there are foods and beverages that can fit within the dietary guidelines framework start with personal preferences exposure to different types of food is important early in life to better develop a childs interest and willingness to eat and enjoy a variety of foods through each life stage that follows a key starting point for establishing and maintaining a healthy dietary pattern is to ensure that individual andor family preferencesin nutrientdense formsare built into daytoday choices incorporate cultural traditions cultural background can have significant influence on food and beverage choices customizing the dietary guidelines framework to reflect specific cultures and traditions is an important strategy to help communities across the country eat and enjoy a healthy dietary pattern nutrientdense culturally relevant foods and beverages are part of all of the food groups spices and herbs can help flavor foods when reducing added sugars saturated fat and sodium and they also can add to the enjoyment of nutrientdense foods dishes and meals that reflect specific cultures relying on the expertise of professionals in nutrition and in specific cultural foodways can help people prepare foods healthfully while retaining heritage consider budget despite a common perception that eating healthfully is expensive a healthy dietary pattern can be affordable and fit within budgetary constraints there are a range of strategies that can be used to help individuals and families follow a healthy dietary pattern including advanced planning considering regional and seasonal food availability and incorporating a variety of fresh frozen dried and canned options the usda food plansthrifty lowcost moderatecost and liberalcost food planseach represent a nutritious diet at a different cost level these plans are scheduled to be revised with an updated thrifty food plan published by the end of 2022

needs with nutrientdense foods and beverages and stay within calorie limits the dietary guidelines include recommendations for food groupsvegetables fruits grains dairy and protein foods eaten at an appropriate calorie level and in forms with limited amounts of added sugars saturated fat and sodium science shows that these same core elements of a healthy dietary pattern are consistent across each life stage however as shown in figure 16 when compared to the healthy usstyle dietary pattern most americans have substantial room for improvement more than 80 percent have dietary patterns that are low in vegetables fruits and dairy more than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations but are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups figure 16 dietary intakes compared to recommendations percent of the us population ages 1 and older who are below and at or above each dietary goal note recommended daily intake of whole grains is to be at least half of total grain consumption and the limit for refined grains is to be no more than half of total grain consumption data source analysis

patterns eating an appropriate mix of foods from the food groups and subgroupswithin an appropriate calorie levelis important to promote health at each life stage each of the food groups and their subgroups provides an array of nutrients and the amounts recommended reflect eating patterns that have been associated with positive health outcomes foods from all of the food groups should be eaten in nutrientdense forms the following sections describe special considerations related to each food group vegetables healthy dietary patterns include a variety of vegetables from all five vegetable subgroupsdark green red and orange beans peas and lentils starchy and other these include all fresh frozen canned and dried options in cooked or raw forms including 100 vegetable juices vegetables in their nutrientdense forms have limited additions such as salt butter or creamy sauces examples of vegetables in each of the subgroups are available in appendix 3 almost 90 percent of the us population does not meet the recommendation for vegetables in addition with few exceptions the us population does not meet intake recommendations for any of the vegetable subgroups about 45 percent of all vegetables are eaten as a separate food item about 40 percent as part of a mixed dish and the remainder are mostly consumed as snack foods and condiments vegetables when consumed on their own are generally consumed in forms with additional sodium either from salt added in cooking or added sauces such as soy sauce or bottled stirfry sauces many vegetables are consumed as part of mixed dishes like sandwiches pasta with a tomatobased sauce or casseroles that may have other ingredients that are sources of saturated fat andor sodium for most individuals following a healthy eating pattern will require an increase in total vegetable intake and from all vegetable subgroups shifting to nutrientdense forms and an increase in the variety of different vegetables consumed over time vegetables can be part of many types of mixed dishes from burgers sandwiches and tacos to pizza stews pasta dishes grainbased casseroles and soups strategies to increase vegetable intake include increasing the vegetable content of mixed dishes or eating less of a main dish to allow for more vegetables as side disheskeeping these nutrient dense 3 guideline learn more table a32 in appendix 3 provides the food

beans peas and lentils is a new name for the vegetable subgroup formerly called legumes beans and peas beans peas and lentils which also are known as pulses include the dried edible seeds of legumes the foods in this vegetable subgroup have not changed however the new name of the subgroup more accurately reflects the category of foods included beans include varieties such as kidney beans pinto beans white beans black beans lima beans and fava beans also included are dried peas eg chickpeas blackeyed peas pigeon peas and split peas and lentils edamame which is the soybean in the pod is counted in the beans peas and lentils subgroup even though it is eaten fresh and not dried because beans peas and lentils have a similar nutrient profile to foods in both the vegetable group and the protein foods group they may be thought of as either a vegetable or a protein food when aiming to meet recommended intakes green peas and green string beans are not counted in the beans peas and lentils subgroup because the nutrient content of these vegetables is more similar to vegetables in other subgroups green peas which are not dried before consumption are grouped with starchy vegetables and green beans are in the other vegetables subgroup which includes onions iceberg lettuce celery and cabbage generally foods made from processed soybeans are a part of the nuts seeds and soy products protein foods subgroup dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 1 nutrition and health across the lifespan page 32 fruits the fruit food group includes whole fruits and 100 fruit juice whole fruits include fresh canned frozen and dried forms whole fruits can be eaten in various forms such as cut sliced diced or cubed at least half of the recommended amount of fruit should come from whole fruit rather than 100 juice when juices are consumed they should be 100 juice and always pasteurized or 100 juice diluted with water without added sugars also when selecting canned fruit choose options that are canned with 100 juice or options lowest in added sugars about 80 percent of the us population does not meet fruit recommendations over 60 percent of all fruit intake comes from whole formsfresh canned frozen or driedor 100 juice fruit is generally consumed in nutrientdense forms such as plain bananas apples oranges or grapes however some fruit is consumed as part of foods that may not be nutrientdense such as fruit pie or similar desserts most people would benefit from increasing their intake of fruit mostly as whole fruits in nutrientdense forms a wide variety of fruits are available in the us marketplace some yearround and others seasonally strategies to help achieve this shift include choosing more whole fruits as snacks and including them in meals grains healthy dietary patterns include whole grains and limit the intake of refined grains at least half of total grains should be whole grains individuals who eat refined grains should choose enriched grains individuals who consume all of their grains as whole grains should include some that have been fortified with folic acid grainbased foods in nutrientdense forms limit the additions of added sugars saturated fat and sodium a food is a 100 wholegrain food if the only grains it contains are whole grains a 1 ounceequivalent of 100 whole grains has 16 grams of whole grains the recommendation to consume at least half of total grains as whole grains can be met in a number of ways choose 100 wholegrain foods for at least half of all grains consumed the relative amount of whole grain in the food can be inferred by the placement of the grain in the ingredient list the whole grain should be the first ingredientor the second ingredient after water for foods with multiple wholegrain ingredients they should appear near the beginning of the ingredient list choose products with at least 50 percent of the total weight as wholegrain ingredients if a food has at least 8 grams of whole grains per ounceequivalent then half of the grains are wholegrain ingredients most americans meet recommendations for total grain intakes although 98 percent fall below recommendations for whole grains and 74 percent exceed limits for refined grains almost half of all intake of refined grains is from mixed dishes such as sandwiches burgers tacos pizza macaroni and cheese and spaghetti with meatballs about 20 percent of intake of refined grains comes from snacks and sweets including crackers pretzels cakes cookies and other grain desserts the remaining refined grains are generally eaten as separate food items such as pancakes cereals breads tortillas pasta or rice about 60 percent of wholegrain intake in the united states is from individual food items mostly cereals and crackers rather than mixed dishes grains are generally consumed in forms with higher amounts of sodium eg breads tortillas crackers and added sugars eg grain based desserts many readytoeat breakfast cereals rather than the nutrientdense forms further grains are often consumed as part of mixed dishes such as pasta dishes casseroles and sandwiches that may have other ingredients that are not in nutrientdense forms shifting from refined to wholegrain versions of commonly consumed foodssuch as from white to 100 wholewheat breads and white to brown rice where culturally appropriatewould increase wholegrain intakes and lower refined grain intakes to help meet recommendations additionally shifting to more nutrient dense forms of grains such as readytoeat breakfast cereals with less sugar will help meet healthy dietary patterns with careful planning limited amounts of salt butter or sources of added sugars can be used to make 3 guideline page 33 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 1 nutrition and health across the lifespan 3 guideline some grainbased foods more palatable while staying within calorie and nutrient limits but most grains should be eaten in their most nutrientdense forms reducing intakes of cakes cookies and other grain desserts will also support reducing refined grain intakes and staying within calorie needs dairy and fortified soy alternatives healthy dietary patterns feature dairy including fatfree and lowfat 1 milk yogurt and cheese individuals who are lactose intolerant can choose lowlactose and lactosefree dairy products for individuals who choose dairy alternatives fortified soy beverages commonly known as soy milk and soy yogurtwhich are fortified with calcium vitamin a and vitamin dare included as part of the dairy group because they are similar to milk and yogurt based on nutrient composition and in their use in meals other products sold as milks but made from plants eg almond rice coconut oat and hemp milks may contain calcium and be consumed as a source of calcium but they are not included as part of the dairy group because their overall nutritional content is not similar to dairy milk and fortified soy beverages therefore consuming these beverages does not contribute to meeting the dairy group recommendation about 90 percent of the us population does not meet dairy recommendations the percent of americans who drink milk as a beverage on a given day is 65 percent among young children 34 percent in adolescents and about 20 percent for adults dairy is generally consumed in forms with higher amounts of sodium eg cheeses as part of mixed dishes such as sandwiches pizza and pasta dishes and saturated fat eg higher fat milks and yogurts and can be a source of added sugars such as flavored milk ice cream and sweetened yogurts most individuals would benefit by increasing intake of dairy in fatfree or lowfat forms whether from milk including lactosefree milk yogurt and cheese or from fortified soy beverages or soy yogurt strategies to increase dairy intake include drinking fatfree or lowfat milk or a fortified soy beverage with meals or incorporating unsweetened fatfree or lowfat yogurt into breakfast or snacks protein foods healthy dietary patterns include a variety of protein foods in nutrientdense forms the protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods from both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups meats poultry and eggs seafood and nuts seeds and soy products as noted previously beans peas and lentils may be considered a part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetable group protein also is found in some foods from other food groups such as dairy meats and poultry vary in fat content and include both fresh and processed forms most intake of meats and poultry should be from fresh frozen or canned and in lean forms eg chicken breast or ground turkey versus processed meats eg hot dogs sausages ham luncheon meats a healthy vegetarian dietary pattern can be achieved by incorporating protein foods from plants compared with the healthy usstyle dietary pattern the healthy vegetarian dietary pattern is higher in soy products particularly tofu and other processed soy products beans peas and lentils nuts and seeds and whole grains inclusion of dairy and eggs make this an example of a lactoovo vegetarian pattern meats poultry and seafood are not included seafood which includes fish and shellfish is a protein foods subgroup that provides beneficial fatty acids eg eicosapentaenoic acid epa and docosahexaenoic acid dha in addition mercury in the form of methylmercury is found in seafood in varying levels the us food and drug administration fda and the us environmental protection agency epa provide dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 1 nutrition and health across the lifespan page 34 3 guideline joint advice regarding seafood consumption to limit methylmercury exposure for women who might become or are pregnant or lactating and young children2 seafood choices higher in epa and dha and lower in methylmercury are encouraged seafood varieties commonly consumed in the united states that are higher in epa and dha and lower in methylmercury include salmon anchovies sardines pacific oysters and trout tilapia shrimp catfish crab and flounder are commonly consumed varieties that also are lower in methylmercury intakes of protein foods are close to the target amounts but many americans do not meet recommendations for specific protein subgroups about threequarters of americans meet or exceed the recommendation for meats poultry and eggs however almost 90 percent do not meet the recommendation for seafood and more than half do not meet the recommendation for nuts seeds and soy products slightly less than half 43 of all protein foods are consumed as a separate food item such as a chicken breast a steak an egg a fish filet or peanuts about the same proportion are consumed as part of a mixed dish 48 with the largest amount from sandwiches including burgers and tacos protein foods are generally consumed in forms with higher amounts of saturated fat or sodium and often part of mixed dishes eg sandwiches casseroles pasta dishes that include other ingredients that are not in nutrientdense forms shifts are needed within the protein foods group to add variety to subgroup intakes selecting from the seafood subgroup or the beans peas and lentils subgroup more often could help meet recommendations while still ensuring adequate protein consumption replacing processed or highfat meats eg hot dogs sausages bacon with seafood could help lower intake of saturated fat and sodium nutrients that are often consumed in excess of recommended limits replacing processed or highfat meats with beans peas and lentils would have similar benefits as well as increasing dietary fiber a dietary component of public health concern 2 available at fdagovfishadvice and epagovfishadvice follow

consumed oils include canola corn olive peanut safflower soybean and sunflower oils oils also are naturally present in nuts seeds seafood olives and avocados the fat in some tropical plants such as coconut oil palm kernel oil and palm oil are not included in the oils category because they contain a higher percentage of saturated fat than do other oils strategies to shift intake include cooking with vegetable oil in place of fats high in saturated fat including butter shortening lard or coconut oil however some foods such as desserts and sweet snacks that are prepared with oils instead of fats high in saturated fat are still high in added sugars and are thus not a nutrientdense food choice beverages when choosing beverages in a healthy dietary pattern both the calories and nutrients that they provide are important considerations beverages that are caloriefreeespecially wateror that contribute beneficial nutrients such as fatfree and lowfat milk and 100 juice should be the primary

across food groups has resulted in underconsumption of some nutrients and dietary components calcium potassium dietary fiber and vitamin d are considered dietary components of public health concern for the general us population because low intakes are associated with health concerns additional dietary components that are underconsumed during specific life stages are highlighted in subsequent chapters if a healthy dietary pattern is consumed amounts of calcium potassium and dietary fiber can meet recommendations individuals should be encouraged to make shifts to increase the intake of vegetables fruits beans whole grains and dairy to move intakes of these underconsumed dietary components closer to recommendations in some cases fortified foods and dietary supplements may be useful in providing one or more nutrients that otherwise may be consumed in less than recommended amounts vitamin d recommendations are harder to achieve through natural sources from diet alone and would require consuming foods and beverages fortified with vitamin d in many cases taking a vitamin d supplement may be appropriate especially when sunlight exposure is limited due to climate or the use of

calories consumed offers a small amount of leeway to add minimal amounts of added sugars or saturated fat to the diet for example one way to use remaining calories is to add small amounts of added sugars or saturated fat to some nutrientdense foods to help make some foods more palatable while working towards meeting food group recommendationsfor example oatmeal with a small amount of brown sugar or vegetables prepared with small amounts of butter however to achieve a healthy dietary pattern all or mostly all food group recommendations should be met with foods and beverages that are in nutrientdense forms a healthy dietary pattern has little room available for foods and beverages high in added sugars saturated fat andor sodium intakes of foods and beverages high in these components should be limited these foods and beverages should be occasional choices consumed in small portions while intakes of added sugars saturated fat and sodium should be limited the guidance below is intended to allow programs and individuals to have some flexibility to choose a healthy dietary pattern within calorie limits that fits personal preferences and cultural traditionsand allows daytoday flexibility to support a healthy dietary pattern over time additionally if alcoholic beverages are consumed intakes should be within the limits described in this chapter and calories should be accounted for to keep total calorie intake at an appropriate level added sugars a healthy dietary pattern limits added sugars to less than 10 percent of calories per day added sugars can help with preservation contribute to functional attributes such as viscosity texture body color and browning capability andor help improve the palatability of some nutrientdense foods in fact the nutrient dense choices included in the healthy usstyle dietary pattern are based on availability in the us food supply and include 1750 calories from added sugars or 152 percent of total calories foods and beverages high in calories from added sugars should be limited to help achieve healthy dietary patterns within calorie limits when added sugars in foods and beverages exceed 10 percent of calories a healthy dietary pattern within calories limits is very difficult to achieve most americans have less than 8 percent of calories available for added sugars including the added sugars inherent to a healthy dietary pattern the limit for added sugars is based on the following assumptions 4 guideline dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 1 nutrition and health across the lifespan page 42 4 guideline most calorie levels have less than 15 percent of calories remaining after meeting food group recommendations through nutrientdense choices approximately half of remaining calories are consumed as saturated fat and half consumed as added sugars total saturated fat intakes meet the recommendation for less than 10 percent of total calorie intake no alcoholic beverages are consumed overall calorie intake does not exceed intake needs to maintain or achieve a healthy weight based on the assumptions above an individual who needs 2000 calories per day based on age sex and physical activity level has less than 7 percent of calories available for added sugars individuals who need 2800 calories per day or less have less than 8 percent of calories available for added sugars individuals who need more than 3000 calories may have a total of 9 to 10 percent of calories available for added sugars in this portion of the population that requires high calorie intake an upper limit of 10 percent of calories from added sugars may be consumed while still meeting food group recommendations in nutrient dense forms the 10 percent added sugar limit allows for flexibility in food choices over time but also requires careful planning for example if one chooses to eat less than the allotted amount of calories for saturated fat 10 percent of added sugars may fit in a healthy dietary pattern added sugars account on average for almost 270 caloriesor more than 13 percent of total caloriesper day in the us population as shown in figure 110 the major sources of added sugars in typical us diets are sugarsweetened beverages desserts and sweet snacks sweetened coffee and tea and candy together these food categories make up more than half of the intake of all added sugars while contributing very little to food group recommendations individuals have many potential options for reducing the intake of added sugars including reducing the intake of major sources of added sugars strategies include reducing portions consuming these items less often and selecting options low in added sugars for those with a weight loss goal limiting intake of foods and beverages high in added sugars is a strategy to help reduce calorie intake it should be noted that replacing added sugars with low and nocalorie sweeteners may reduce calorie intake in the shortterm and aid in weight

particularly polyunsaturated fats although some saturated fat is inherent in foods eg highfat meat some sources are added eg butter on toast similar to added sugars some of the nutrientdense choices included in the healthy usstyle dietary pattern include saturated fat approximately 5 percent of total calories inherent to the nutrientdense foods in the healthy usstyle dietary pattern are from saturated fat from sources such as lean meat poultry and eggs nuts and seeds grains and saturated fatty acids in oils as such there is little room to include additional saturated fat in a healthy dietary pattern while staying within limits for saturated fat and total calories current average intakes of saturated fat are 11 percent of calories only 23 percent of individuals consume amounts of saturated fat consistent with the limit of less than 10 percent of calories the main sources of saturated fat in the us diet include sandwiches including burgers tacos and burritos desserts and sweet snacks and rice pasta and other grainbased mixed dishes figure 111 saturated fat is commonly found in higher amounts in highfat meat fullfat dairy products eg whole milk ice cream cheese butter coconut oil and palm kernel and palm oil strategies to lower saturated fat intake include reducing intakes of dessert and sweet snacks by consuming smaller portion sizes and eating these foods less often additional strategies include reading food labels to choose packaged foods lower in saturated fats and choosing lower fat forms of foods and beverages eg fatfree or lowfat milk instead of 2 percent or whole milk lean rather than fatty cuts of meat when cooking and purchasing meals select lean meat and lower fat cheese in place of highfat meats and regular cheeseor replace them with ingredients with oils such as nuts seeds or avocado cook and purchase products made with oils higher in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat eg canola corn olive peanut safflower soybean and sunflower rather than butter shortening or coconut or palm oils a note on trans fats and dietary cholesterol the national academies recommends that trans fat and dietary cholesterol consumption to be

intakes for those ages 1 and older is 3393 milligrams per day with a range of about 2000 to 5000 mg per day only a small proportion of total sodium intake is from sodium inherent in foods or from salt added in home cooking or at the table most sodium consumed in the united states comes from salt added during commercial food processing and preparation including foods prepared at restaurants sodium is found in foods from almost all food categories across the food supply figure 112 including mixed dishes such as sandwiches burgers and tacos rice pasta and grain dishes pizza meat poultry and seafood dishes and soups calorie intake is highly associated with sodium intake ie the more foods and beverages people consume the more sodium they tend to consume because sodium is found in so many

does not recommend that individuals who do not drink alcohol start drinking for any reason there are also some people who should not drink at all such as if they are pregnant or might be pregnant under the legal age for drinking if they have certain medical conditions or are taking certain medications that can interact with alcohol and if they are recovering from an alcohol use disorder or if they are unable to control the amount they drink if adults age 21 years and older choose to drink alcoholic beverages drinking less is better for health than drinking more evidence indicates that among those who drink higher average alcohol consumption is associated with an increased risk of death from all causes compared with lower average alcohol consumption alcohol misuse or consuming alcohol in excess of recommendations increases risk of several other conditions such as liver disease cardiovascular disease injuries and alcohol use disorders for the purposes of evaluating amounts of alcohol that may be consumed the dietary guidelines defines drink equivalents one alcoholic drink equivalent is defined as containing 14 grams 06 fl oz of pure alcohol the following count as one alcoholic drink equivalent 12 fluid ounces of regular beer 5 alcohol 5 fluid ounces of wine 12 alcohol or 15 fluid ounces of 80 proof distilled spirits 40 alcohol to help americans move toward a healthy dietary pattern and minimize risks associated with drinking adults of legal drinking age can choose not to drink or to drink in moderation by limiting intakes to 2 drinks or less in a day for men and 1 drink or less in a day for women on days when alcohol is consumed this is not intended as an average over several days but rather the amount consumed on any single day binge drinking3 defined as 5 or more drinks for the typical adult male or 4 or more drinks for the typical adult female in about 2 hours should be avoided emerging evidence suggests that even drinking within the recommended limits may increase the overall risk of death from various causes such as from several types of cancer and some forms of cardiovascular disease alcohol has been found to increase risk for cancer and for some types of cancer the risk increases even at low levels of alcohol consumption less than 1 drink in a day caution therefore is recommended alcoholic beverages are not a component of the usda dietary patterns the amount of alcohol and calories in beverages varies and should be accounted for within the limits of healthy dietary patterns so that calorie limits are not exceeded see calories in alcoholic beverages approximately 60 percent of adults report alcoholic beverage consumption in the past month of those approximately 30 percent binge drink sometimes multiple times per month during days when men and women consume alcohol their consumption typically exceeds current guidance among adults including those who do not drink alcoholic beverages contribute approximately 5 percent of calorie intake 3 to 4 of calories for women and 5 to 7 for men this translates into approximately 9 percent of calories among those who drink as such among those who drink alcoholic beverages alone account for most of the calories that remain after meeting food group recommendations in nutrientdense formsleaving very few calories for added sugars or saturated fat adults who choose to drink and are not among the individuals listed above who should not drink are encouraged to limit daily intakes to align with the dietary guidelinesand to consider calories from alcoholic beverages so as not to exceed daily calorie limits 3 more information is available at niaaanihgovalcoholhealthoverviewalcoholconsumptionmoderatebingedrinking 4 guideline calories in alcoholic beverages alcoholic beverages supply calories but few nutrients and calories from alcoholic beverages should be accounted for to keep total calorie intake at an appropriate level alcoholic beverages may contain calories from both alcohol and other ingredients such as soda juice and added sugars it is important to consider ingredients and portion size the range of calories in cocktails varies widely depending on serving size and ingredients examples of calories contained in alcoholic beverages include 12 fluid ounces of regular beer 5 alcohol about 150 calories 5 fluid ounces of wine 12 alcohol about 120 calories 15 fluid ounces of 80 proof distilled spirits 40 alcohol about 100 calories 7 fluid ounces of a rum 40 alcohol and cola about 190 calories more information on calories in

page 50 4 guideline support healthy dietary patterns for all americans everyone has a role to play to support access to healthy foods and beverages in multiple settings nationwide where people live learn work play and gather having access to healthy safe and affordable food is crucial for an individual to achieve a healthy dietary pattern concerted efforts within communities businesses and industries organizations government and other segments of society are needed to support individuals and families in making lifestyle choices that align with the dietary guidelines food manufacturers and retail establishments can support americans in achieving a healthy dietary pattern by providing healthy options in all the places where foods and beverages are purchased during the past few decades food products and menus have evolved substantially in response to consumer demand and public health concerns food reformulation and menu and retail modification opportunities include offering more vegetables fruits whole grains lowfat and fatfree dairy and a greater variety of protein foods that are nutrient dense while also reducing sodium and added sugars reducing saturated fat and replacing it with unsaturated fats and reducing added refined starches portion sizes also can be reduced to help individuals make choices that better fit within their calorie needs food manufacturers are encouraged to consider the entire composition of the food or beverage and not just individual nutrients or ingredients when developing or reformulating products similarly when developing or modifying menus establishments can consider the range of offerings both within and across food groups and other dietary components to determine whether the healthy options offered reflect the proportions in healthy dietary patterns in taking these actions care should be taken to assess any potential unintended consequences so that as changes are made to better align with the dietary guidelines undesirable changes are not introduced for example a change made to reduce the amount of added sugars in a product should not come at the expense of increasing the amount of saturated fat or sodium food access is influenced by diverse factors such as proximity to food retail outlets eg the number and types of stores in an area ability to prepare ones own meals or eat independently and the availability of personal or public transportation the underlying socioeconomic characteristics of a neighborhood also may influence an individuals ability to access foods to support healthy eating patterns in 2019 105 percent of households were food insecure at least some time during the year food insecurity occurs when access to nutritionally adequate and safe food is limited or uncertain food insecurity can be temporary or persist over time preventing individuals and families from following a healthy dietary pattern that aligns with the dietary guidelines the prevalence of food insecurity typically rises during times of economic downturn as households experience greater hardship government and nongovernment nutrition assistance programs help alleviate food insecurity and play an essential role by providing food meals and educational resources so that participants can make healthy food choices within their budget chapters 2 3 4 5 and 6 highlight examples of these resources at each life stage as discussed in subsequent chapters everyone has an important role in leading disease prevention efforts within their organizations and communities to make healthy eating an organizational and societal norm changes at multiple levels of society are needed and these changes in combination and over time can have a meaningful impact on the health of current and future generations looking toward the life stages this chapter has provided guidance about the fundamentals of a healthy dietary pattern these fundamentals are remarkably consistent across life stages even though each stage also has its own specific nutrition considerations the following chapters build on this chapter and take a closer look at each of the life stages chapter 2 provides a focused discussion of the unique nutritional needs of infants and toddlers chapters 3 4 5 and 6 present recommended dietary patterns describe current nutrition intakes and provide tailored nutrition

infants and toddlers page 52 infants and toddlers birth through 23 months page 53 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 2 infants and toddlers introduction t he time from birth until a childs second birthday is a critically important period for proper growth and development it also is key for establishing healthy dietary patterns that may influence the trajectory of eating behaviors and health throughout the life course during this period nutrients critical for brain development and growth must be provided in adequate amounts children in this age group consume small quantities of foods so its important to make every bite count key recommendations for about the first 6 months of life exclusively feed infants human milk continue to feed infants human milk through at least the first year of life and longer if desired feed infants ironfortified infant formula during the first year of life when human milk is unavailable provide infants with supplemental vitamin d beginning soon after birth at about 6 months introduce infants to nutrientdense complementary foods introduce infants to potentially allergenic foods along with other complementary foods encourage infants and toddlers to consume a variety of foods from all food groups include foods rich in iron and zinc particularly for infants fed human milk avoid foods and beverages with added sugars limit foods and beverages higher in sodium as infants wean from human milk or infant formula transition to a healthy dietary pattern birth through 23 months dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 2 infants and toddlers page 54 human milk feeding alone is the ideal form of nutrition from birth through about age 6 months human milk provides necessary nutrients protective factors against disease and other unique immunological benefits if human milk is unavailable infants should be fed an iron fortified commercial infant formula once an infant is developmentally ready foods and beverages should be introduced to complement human milk feeding these complementary foods and beverages are essential to meet the nutrient requirements of infants starting at about age 6 months and should be selected carefully to help meet these needs as an infant becomes a toddler and learns to eat a variety of foods flavors and textures the goal of complementary feeding becomes establishing a healthy dietary pattern and transitioning to a healthy family diet by age 2 putting the key recommendations into action feed infants human milk for the first 6 months if possible exclusive human milk feeding is one of the best ways to start an infant off on the path of lifelong healthy nutrition exclusive human milk feeding commonly referred to as exclusive breastfeeding refers to an infant consuming only human milk and not in combination with infant formula andor complementary foods or beverages including water except for medications or vitamin and mineral supplementation human milk can support an infants nutrient needs for about the first 6 months of life with the exception of vitamin d and potentially iron in addition to nutrients human milk includes bioactive substances and immunologic properties that support infant health and growth and development us data show that about 84 percent of infants born in 2017 were ever fed human milk with only 25 percent fed human milk exclusively through age 6 months and 35 percent continuing to be fed any human milk at age 12 months nearly onequarter of infants were fed some human milk beyond age 12 months with about 15 percent of toddlers being fed human milk at age 18 months families may have a number of reasons for not having human milk for their infant for example a family may choose not to breastfeed a child may be adopted or the mother may be unable to produce a full milk supply or may be unable to pump and store milk safely due to family or workplace pressures if human milk is unavailable infants should be fed an ironfortified commercial infant formula ie labeled with iron regulated by the us food and drug administration fda which is based on standards that ensure nutrient content and safety infant formulas are designed to meet the nutritional needs of infants and are not needed beyond age 12 months it is important to take precautions to ensure that expressed human milk and prepared infant formula are handled and stored safely see proper handling and storage of human milk and infant formula donor human milk if families do not have sufficient human milk for their infant but want to feed their infant human milk they may look for alternative ways to obtain it it is important for the family to obtain pasteurized donor human milk from a source such as an accredited human milk bank that has screened its donors and taken appropriate safety precautions when human milk is obtained directly from individuals or through the internet the donor is unlikely to have been screened for infectious diseases and it is unknown whether the human milk has been collected or stored in a way to reduce possible safety risks to the baby more information is available at fdagovscienceresearch pediatricsusedonorhumanmilk birth through 23 months page 55 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 2 infants and toddlers proper handling and storage of human milk and infant formula wash hands thoroughly before expressing human milk or preparing to feed human milk or infant formula if expressing human milk ensure pump parts are thoroughly cleaned before use if preparing powdered infant formula use a safe water source and follow instructions on the label refrigerate freshly expressed human milk within 4 hours for up to 4 days previously frozen and thawed human milk should be used within 24 hours thawed human milk should never be refrozen refrigerate prepared infant formula for up to 24 hours do not use a microwave to warm human milk or infant formula warm safely by placing the sealed container of human milk or infant formula in a bowl of warm water or under warm running tap water once it has been offered to the infant use or discard leftovers quickly within 2 hours for human milk or 1 hour for infant formula thoroughly wash all infant feeding items such as bottles and nipples consider sanitizing feeding items for infants younger than 3 months of age infants born prematurely or infants with a compromised immune system more information on storing and handling human milk is available at cdcgov breastfeedingrecommendationshandling_breastmilkhtm more information on storing and preparing

b12 human milk has sufficient vitamin b12 to meet infant needs unless the mothers vitamin b12 status is inadequate this can occur for different reasons including when the mother eats a strictly vegan diet without any animal source foods when the mother is at risk of vitamin b12 deficiency human milk may not provide sufficient vitamin b12 in these cases the mother andor infant fed human milk may require a vitamin b12 supplement parents caregivers and guardians should consult with a healthcare provider to determine whether supplementation is necessary homemade infant formulas and those that are improperly and illegally imported into the united states without mandated fda review and supervision should not be used toddler milks or toddler formulas should not be fed to infants as they are not designed to meet the nutritional needs of infants provide infants supplemental vitamin d beginning soon after birth all infants who are fed human milk exclusively or who receive both human milk and infant formula mixed fed will need a vitamin d supplement of 400 iu per day beginning soon after birth infant formula is fortified with vitamin d thus when an infant is receiving full feeds of infant formula vitamin d supplementation is not needed families who do not wish to provide a supplement directly to their infant should discuss with a healthcare provider the risks and benefits of maternal high dose supplementation options even when consuming a varied diet achieving adequate vitamin d from foods and beverages natural sources alone is challenging suggesting that young children may need to continue taking a vitamin d supplement after age 12 months parents caregivers and guardians should consult with a healthcare provider to determine how long supplementation is necessary introduce infants to nutrientdense complementary foods at about 6 months old at about age 6 months infants should be introduced to nutrientdense developmentally appropriate foods to complement human milk or infant formula feedings some infants may show developmental signs of readiness before age 6 months see developmental readiness for beginning to eat solid foods but introducing complementary foods before age 4 months is not recommended waiting until after age 6 months to introduce foods also is not recommended starting around that time complementary foods are necessary to ensure adequate nutrition and exposure to flavors textures and different types of foods infants should be given age and developmentally appropriate foods to help prevent choking it is important to introduce potentially allergenic foods along with other complementary foods for infants fed human milk it is particularly important to include complementary foods that are rich in iron and zinc when starting complementary foods see appendix 1 nutritional goals for agesex groups about onethird 32 of infants in the united states are introduced to complementary foods and beverages before age 4 months highlighting the importance of providing guidance and support to parents guardians and caregivers on the timing of introduction to complementary foods early introduction of complementary foods and beverages is higher among infants receiving infant formula 42 or a combination of infant formula and human milk 32 than among infants exclusively fed human milk 19 birth through 23 months page 57 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 2 infants and toddlers developmental readiness for beginning to eat solid foods the age at which infants reach different developmental stages will vary typically between age 4 and 6 months infants develop the gross motor oral and fine motor skills necessary to begin to eat complementary foods as an infants oral skills develop the thickness and texture of foods can gradually be varied signs that an infant is ready for complementary foods include being able to control head and neck sitting up alone or with support bringing objects to the mouth trying to grasp small objects such as toys or food swallowing food rather than pushing it back out onto the chin infants and young children should be given age and developmentally appropriate foods to help prevent choking foods such as hot dogs candy nuts and seeds raw carrots grapes popcorn and chunks of peanut butter are some of the foods that can be a choking risk for young children parents guardians and caregivers are encouraged to take steps to decrease choking risks including offering foods in the appropriate size consistency and shape that will allow an infant or young child to eat and swallow easily making sure the infant or young child is sitting up in a high chair or other safe supervised place ensuring an adult is supervising feeding during mealtimes not putting infant cereal or other solid foods in an infants bottle this could increase the risk of choking and will not make the infant sleep longer more information on foods that can present choking hazards is available from usda at wicworksfns usdagovresourcesreducingriskchokingyoung childrenmealtimes birth through 23 months dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 2 infants and toddlers page 58 introduce infants to potentially allergenic foods along with other complementary foods potentially allergenic foods eg peanuts egg cow milk products tree nuts wheat crustacean shellfish fish and soy should be introduced when other complementary foods are introduced to an infants diet introducing peanutcontaining foods in the first year reduces the risk that an infant will develop a food allergy to peanuts cow milk as a beverage should be introduced at age 12 months or later see establish a healthy beverage pattern there is no evidence that delaying introduction of allergenic foods beyond when other complementary foods are introduced helps to prevent food allergy for more information see for infants at high risk of peanut allergy introduce peanutcontaining foods at age 4 to 6 months for infants at high risk of peanut allergy introduce peanutcontaining foods at age 4 to 6 months if an infant has severe eczema egg allergy or both conditions that increase the risk of peanut allergy ageappropriate peanut containing foods should be introduced into the diet as early as age 4 to 6 months this will reduce the risk of developing peanut allergy caregivers should check with the infants healthcare provider before feeding the infant peanut containing foods a blood test or skin prick may be recommended to determine whether peanut should be introduced to the infant and if so the safest way to introduce it more information is available in the addendum guidelines for the prevention of peanut allergy in the united states at niaidnihgov sitesdefaultfilesaddendum peanutallergyprevention guidelinespdf birth through 23 months page 59 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 2 infants and toddlers encourage infants and toddlers to consume a variety of complementary foods and beverages to meet energy and nutrient needs parents caregivers and guardians are encouraged to introduce foods across all the food groupsas described below and carrying forward the principles in chapter 1including items that fit within a familys preferences cultural traditions and budget complementary foods and beverages should be rich in nutrients meet calorie and nutrient requirements during this critical period of growth and development and stay within limits of dietary components such as added sugars and sodium although the dietary guidelines does not provide a recommended dietary pattern for infants ages 6 through 11 months infants should be on the path to a healthy dietary pattern that is recommended for those ages 12 through 23 months see appendix 3 usda dietary patterns in the united states some dietary components are of public health concern for infants and toddlers iron is a dietary component of public health concern for underconsumption among older infants ages 6 through 11 months who are fed primarily human milk and consume inadequate iron from complementary foods older infants who are fed primarily human milk also underconsume zinc and protein from complementary foods and vitamin d choline and potassium are notably underconsumed by all older infants during the second year of life the dietary components of public health concern for underconsumption are vitamin d calcium dietary fiber and potassium and for overconsumption are added sugars and sodium lists of dietary sources of iron calcium potassium dietary fiber and vitamin d are available at dietaryguidelinesgov introduce ironrich foods to infants starting at about 6 months old ironrich foods eg meats and seafood rich in heme iron and ironfortified infant cereals are important components of the infants diet from age 6 through 11 months to maintain adequate iron status which supports neurologic development and immune function infants are typically born with body stores of iron adequate for about the first 6 months of life depending on gestational age maternal iron status and timing of umbilical cord clamping by age 6 months however infants require an external source of iron apart from human milk caregivers of infants exclusively fed human milk should talk with their pediatric care provider about whether there may be a need for infants supplementation with iron before age 6 months a complementary food source of iron beginning at about 6 months is particularly important for infants fed human milk because the iron content of human milk is low and maternal iron intake during lactation does not increase its content in the united states an estimated 77 percent of infants fed human milk have inadequate iron intake during the second half of infancy highlighting the importance of introducing ironrich foods starting at age 6 months infants receiving most of their milk feeds as iron fortified infant formula are likely to need less iron from complementary foods beginning at 6 months of age after birth through 23 months dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 2 infants and toddlers page 60 age 12 months children have a lower iron requirement but good food sources of iron are still needed to maintain adequate iron status and prevent deficiency introduce zincrich foods to infants starting at about 6 months old zincrich complementary foods eg meats beans zinc fortified infant cereals are important from age 6 months onwards to support adequate zinc status which supports growth and immune function although the zinc content of human milk is initially high and efficiently absorbed the concentration declines over the first 6 months of lactation and is not affected by maternal zinc intake during the second half of infancy approximately half 54 of us infants fed human milk have inadequate zinc intake prioritizing zincrich foods starting at 6 months of age to complement human milk feedings will help infants meet their requirement for zinc encourage a variety of foods from all food groups to infants starting at about 6 months old to support nutrient adequacy foster acceptance of healthy foods and set intakes on a path toward a healthy pattern it is important to encourage foods from all food groups because very young children are being exposed to new textures and flavors for the first time it may take up to 8 to 10 exposures for an infant to accept a new type of food repeated offering of foods such as fruits and vegetables increases the likelihood of an infant accepting them a nutrientdense diverse diet from age 6 through 23 months of life includes a variety of food sources from each food group protein foods including meats poultry eggs seafood nuts seeds and soy products are important sources of iron zinc protein choline and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids the longchain polyunsaturated fatty acids specifically the essential omega3 and omega6 fatty acids supplied through seafood nuts seeds and oils influence the infants fatty acid status and are among the key nutrients needed for the rapid brain development that occurs through the infants first 2 years of life some types of fish such as salmon and trout are also natural sources of vitamin d to limit exposure to methylmercury from seafood the us food and drug administration and the us environmental protection agency issued joint guidance regarding the types of seafood to choose1 vegetables and fruits especially those rich in potassium vitamin a and vitamin c should be offered to infants and toddlers age 6 through 23 months the vegetable subgroup of beans peas and lentils also provides a good source of protein and dietary fiber for dairy families can introduce yogurt and cheese including soybased yogurt before 12 months however infants should not consume cow milk as a beverage or fortified soy beverage before age 12 months as a replacement for human milk or infant formula see cow milk and fortified soy beverages in the second year of life when calcium requirements increase dairy products including milk yogurt cheese and fortified soy beverages and soy yogurt provide a good source of calcium vitamin dfortified milk and soy beverages also provide a good source of vitamin d for those younger than the age of 2 offer dairy products without added sugar see avoid added sugars grains including ironfortified infant cereal play an important role in meeting nutrient needs during this life stage infant cereals fortified with iron include oat barley multigrain and rice cereals rice cereal fortified with iron is a good source of nutrients for infants but rice cereal shouldnt be the only type of cereal given to infants offering young children whole grains more often than refined grains will increase dietary fiber as well as potassium intake during the second year of life and help young children establish healthy dietary practices 1 us food and drug administration and us environmental protection agency advice about eating fish available at fdagovfishadvice epagovfishadvice birth through 23 months page 61 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 2 infants and toddlers dietary components to limit while encouraging intake from each food group some dietary components should be limited avoid added sugars infants and young children have virtually no room in their diet for added sugars this is because the nutrient requirements for infants and young children are quite high relative to their size but the amount of complementary foods they consume is small complementary foods need to be nutrientdense and not contain additional calories from added sugars in addition low and nocalorie sweeteners which can also be called highintensity sweeteners are not recommended for children younger than age 2 taste preferences are being formed during this time period and infants and young children may develop preferences for overly sweet foods if introduced to very sweet foods during this timeframe for more information on added sugars see chapter 1 avoid foods higher in sodium sodium is found in a number of foods including some salty snacks commercial toddler foods and processed meats in addition to keeping sodium intake within limits for toddlers see appendix 1 another reason to avoid highsodium foods is that taste preferences for salty food may be established early in life choose fresh or lowsodium frozen foods when available and lowsodium canned foods to minimize sodium content for more information on sodium see chapter 1 avoid honey and unpasteurized foods and beverages infants should not be given any foods containing raw or cooked honey honey can contain the clostridium botulinum organism that could cause serious illness or death among infants infants and young children also should not be given any unpasteurized foods or beverages such as unpasteurized juices milk yogurt or cheeses as they could contain harmful bacteria establish a healthy beverage pattern an important part of establishing an overall healthy dietary pattern is careful consideration of beverages guidance for different beverage categories is provided below water for healthy infants with adequate intake of human milk or infant formula supplemental water is typically not needed in the first 6 months small amounts up to 4 to 8 ounces per day of plain fluoridated drinking water can be given to infants with the introduction of complementary foods plain fluoridated drinking water intake can slowly be increased after age 1 to meet hydration and fluoride needs birth through 23 months dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 2 infants and toddlers page 62 cow milk and fortified soy beverages infants should not consume cow milk or fortified soy beverages before age 12 months to replace human milk or infant formula cow milk does not have the correct amount of nutrients for infants and its higher protein and mineral content are hard for an infants kidneys and digestive system to process plain cow milk whole milk or fortified unsweetened soy beverage can be offered beginning around 12 months of age to help meet calcium potassium vitamin d and protein needs flavored milks for children age 12 through 23 months should be avoided because they contain added sugars plantbased milk alternatives plantbased milk alternatives which are sometimes referred to as milk alternatives include beverages made from plants such as soy oat rice coconut and almond these beverages should not be used in the first year of life to replace human milk or infant formula they may come in different flavors and some forms have added sugars unsweetened versions of these beverages may be accommodated in small amounts in the diet during the second year of life but most have significantly less protein than cow milk and are not always fortified with calcium and vitamin d among plantbased milk alternatives only fortified soy beverage is currently considered a dairy equivalent thus consuming other plantbased beverages does not contribute to meeting dairy recommendations 100 fruit juice before age 12 months 100 fruit or vegetable juices should not be given to infants in the second year of life fruit juice is not necessary and most fruit intake should come from eating whole fruit if 100 fruit juice is provided up to 4 ounces per day can fit in a healthy dietary pattern juices that contain added sugars should be avoided toddler milk and toddler drinks there are no clear needs for toddler milks or drinks needed nutrients can be obtained from cow milk or fortified soy beverage and appropriate solid foods toddler milks and toddler drinks are drinks supplemented with nutrients and typically contain added sugars a variety of nutrientdense complementary foods and beverages without added sugars should be emphasized for achieving nutrient recommendations sugarsweetened beverages sugarsweetened beverages eg regular soda juice drinks not 100 fruit juice sports drinks and flavored water with sugar should not be given to children younger than age 2 drinks labeled as fruit drinks or fruitflavored drinks are not the same as 100 fruit juice and contain added sugars these beverages displace nutrientdense beverages and foods in the diet of young children infants and toddlers do not have room in their diets for the additional calories from added sugars found in these beverages in addition sugarsweetened beverage intake in infancy and early childhood may predispose children to consume more of these beverages later in life caffeinated beverages concerns exist about potential negative health effects of caffeine for young children and no safe limits of caffeine have been established for this age group caffeine is a stimulant that can occur naturally in foods and beverages or as an additive major sources of caffeine for americans include beverages such as soft drinks tea coffee and sports drinks beverages containing caffeine should be avoided for children younger than age 2 birth through 23 months page 63 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 2 infants and toddlers healthy dietary pattern during a toddlers second year of life in the second year of life toddlers consume less human milk and infant formula is not recommended calories and nutrients should predominantly be met from a healthy dietary pattern of ageappropriate foods and beverages the healthy usstyle dietary pattern presented here is intended for toddlers ages 12 through 23 months who no longer consume human milk or infant formula the pattern represents the types and amounts of foods needed to meet energy and nutrition requirements for this period table 21 for toddlers who are still consuming human milk approximately onethird at 12 months and 15 percent at 18 months a healthy dietary pattern should include a similar combination of nutrientdense complementary foods and beverages table 21 displays the healthy usstyle dietary pattern to illustrate the specific amounts and limits for food groups and other dietary components that make up healthy dietary patterns the pattern is provided at calorie levels ranging from 700 to 1000 calories per day which are appropriate for most toddlers ages 12 through 23 months see appendix 2 estimated calorie needs a healthy dietary pattern includes a variety of nutrientdense fruits vegetables grains protein foods including lean meats poultry eggs seafood nuts and seeds dairy including milk yogurt and cheese and oils based on fda and epas joint advice about eating fish young children should eat seafood lowest in methylmercury and certain species of seafood should be avoided2 if young children are lower in body weight they should eat less seafood than the amounts in the healthy usstyle dietary pattern more information is available on the fda or epa websites at fdagovfishadvice and epagov fishadvice after food group and subgroup recommendations are met a small number of calories are allocated to oils the recommendation to limit saturated fat to less than 10 percent of calories per day does not apply to those younger than age 2 and the inclusion of higher fat versions of dairy is a notable difference in the pattern for toddlers ages 12 through 23 months compared to patterns for ages 2 and older however no calories remain in the pattern for additional saturated fat or for added sugars to illustrate the concept of nutrient density figure 21 shows examples of foods and beverages appropriate for this life stage in forms that are not in nutrientdense forms compared to those that are in nutrientdense forms this dietary pattern requires careful choices of foods and beverages but does not require inclusion of fortified products specifically formulated for infants or toddlers to meet nutrient recommendations figure 21 make healthy shifts to empower toddlers to eat nutrientdense foods in dietary patterns science shows that early food preferences influence later food choices make the first choice the healthiest choices that set the toddlers on a path of making nutrientdense choices in the years to come examples of shifts in common choices to healthier more nutrientdense food choices include cereal with added sugars cereal with minimal added sugars fruit products with added sugars fruit eg canned in 100 juice roasted

chapter 2 infants and toddlers vegetarian dietary pattern during the second year of life a healthy vegetarian dietary pattern for young children ages 12 through 23 months who are not fed human milk or infant formula is included in appendix 3 this pattern describes a lactoovo vegetarian diet that includes regular consumption of eggs dairy products soy products and nuts or seeds in addition to vegetables including beans peas and lentils fruits grains and oils iron may be of particular concern because plant source foods contain only nonheme iron which is less bioavailable than is heme iron food source lists for both heme and nonheme iron are available at dietaryguidelinesgov vitamin b12 also may be of concern because it is present only in animal source foods when feeding infants and toddlers a lactoovo vegetarian diet parents caregivers and guardians should consult with a healthcare provider to determine whether supplementation of iron vitamin b12 andor other nutrients is necessary and if so appropriate levels to meet their unique needs supporting healthy eating parents guardians and caregivers play an important role in nutrition during this life stage because infants and toddlers are fully reliant on them for their needs in addition to what to feed children how to feed young children also is critical as noted above repeated exposure to foods can increase acceptance of new foods another important concept is responsive feeding a feeding style that emphasizes recognizing and responding to the hunger or fullness cues of an infant or young child see responsive feeding responsive feeding responsive feeding is a term used to describe a feeding style that emphasizes recognizing and responding to the hunger or fullness cues of an infant or young child responsive feeding helps young children learn how to self regulate their intake see table 22 for some examples of signs a child may show for hunger and fullness when he or she is a newborn through age 5 months and signs a child may start to show between age 6 through 23 months it is important to listen to the childs hunger and fullness cues to build healthy eating habits during this critical age if parents guardians or caregivers have questions or concerns a conversation with a healthcare provider will be helpful for more information on signs a child is hungry or full see

many resources exist to support healthy growth and development during infancy and toddlerhood these include the following government programs that aim to support a healthy dietary pattern for infants and toddlers living in households with limited incomes the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic supports infant and early childhood nutrition through supplementing the diets of women who are pregnant or lactating and by providing breastfeeding support and ironfortified infant formula when human milk is unavailable or fed only partially wic accommodates the transition to solid foods by providing nutrientdense foods in the supplemental food packages offered to older infants and toddlers nutrition education and counseling and referrals to healthcare and social services are other important resources offered to incomeeligible wic participants the child and adult care food program cacfp provides reimbursement for nutrientdense meals and snacks served to infants and toddlers in participating child care centers including at head start programs and day care homes where infants and toddlers also have access to health screenings and families can be connected to health services to support their overall wellbeing the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap is the largest food assistance program in the united states snap helps meet the nutritional needs of infants and toddlers living in lowincome households by providing temporary monthly benefits that can be used to access a healthy dietary pattern these government nutrition programs are especially important for the 14 percent3 of families with children who experience food insecurity and may struggle to access the foods needed to support a healthy dietary pattern professionals can use these and additional government and nongovernment resources that exist within communities to support healthy eating during infancy and toddlerhood looking toward chapter 3 children and adolescents this chapter focused on nutrition issues important to infants and toddlers exclusive human milk feeding if possible introducing nutrientdense complementary foods at about age 6 months and encouraging infants and toddlers to sample and consume a variety of nutrientdense foods and beverages to meet their needs as toddlers grow and their dietary patterns become more integrated with the familys food patterns new issues arise these issues and how to accommodate them within a lifelong healthy dietary pattern are discussed in the next chapter which focuses on children and adolescents 3 more information on food insecurity is available at ersusdagovdataproductsagand foodstatisticschartingtheessentialsfoodsecurityandnutritionassistance ages 218 page 69

hildren and adolescents include individuals ages 2 through 18 a life stage characterized by transitions and the formation of dietary patterns suboptimal current intake patterns among children and adolescents and inadequate physical activity contribute to overweight and obesity in this life stage and risk of chronic disease eg type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease later in life changing this trajectory is crucial because dietary patterns established during this life stage tend to continue into adult years healthy eating throughout this life stage involves the child or adolescent families and caregivers and institutions and settings where food is provided and consumed young children are fully reliant on others to provide their meals and snacks as children transition to schoolage and through adolescence they are exposed to new food choices and begin to have more autonomy in the foods that are selected new influences on eating behavior also emerge such as peer pressure which can create opportunities or challenges for establishing dietary patterns consistent with health and longevity adolescents acquire evergreater independence in their food choices as they mature with more time spent on their own with peers and more foods and beverages frequently consumed in social settings other factors that influence eating behavior include social supports exposure to food marketing and promotion and policies that determine community design youth have diverse calorie and nutrient needs based on age and patterns of growth development and physical activity current intake data of young children show some components of a healthy dietary pattern that continue from the infant and toddler life stages before these components of a healthy dietary pattern are established however diet quality worsens through childhood and into adolescence and intake patterns drift further from recommendations in the dietary guidelines active community support is needed to help youth meet food group and nutrient goals with nutrient dense foods and beverages ages 218 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 3 children and adolescents page 72 childhood overweight and obesity in the united states 41 percent of children and adolescents are overweight or have obesity and the prevalence is higher among hispanic and nonhispanic black children and adolescents as compared to nonhispanic asians and whites overweight and obesity put youth at high risk of serious health concerns youth with obesity are more likely to have immediate health risks including high blood pressure high cholesterol and impaired glucose tolerance they also are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes beginning as soon as the teenage years and into adulthood psychological eg anxiety depression and social concerns eg bullying stigma also are more likely in children and adolescents with overweight or obesity the causes of childhood obesity are complex and interconnected behaviors eg eating habits level of physical activity sedentary time and the community in which a child or adolescent resides can influence risk of obesity genetics and the fetal environment also play a role in the development of obesity however many opportunities exist to help prevent or manage overweight and obesity as children transition through these life stages the goal for children and adolescents with overweight or obesity is to reduce the rate of weight gain while allowing normal growth and development this can primarily be done by emphasizing nutrientdense food and beverage choices minimizing calories from sources that do not contribute to a healthy dietary pattern and encouraging regular physical activity healthy dietary patterns children and adolescents are encouraged to follow the recommendations on the types of foods and beverages that make up a healthy dietary pattern described in chapter 1 nutrition and health across the lifespan the guidelines and key recommendations tables 31 to 33 display the healthy usstyle dietary pattern to illustrate the specific amounts and limits for food groups and other dietary components that make up healthy dietary

through the selection of nutrientdense foods and beverages calorie needs generally increase throughout this life stage to support growth and development child and adolescent females generally have lower calorie needs than do males with variations based on size and level of physical activity during adolescence the range of calorie intakes widens to support diverse growth trajectories more

provide a framework to help children and adolescents follow a healthy dietary pattern and meet the guidelines and their key recommendations the usda foods patterns can be customized based on dietary needs personal preferences and budgetary constraints a variety of nutrientdense foods and beverages can be selected across the food group and subgroups as part of an overall healthy dietary pattern

calories per day and males require about 1200 to 2000 calories per day physical activity childhood and adolescence is a critical period for developing movement skills learning healthy habits and establishing a firm foundation for lifelong health and wellbeing for youth regular physical activity can improve bone health cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness and cognition including academic achievement and reduce the symptoms of depression preschoolaged children should be active throughout the day to enhance growth and development adults caring for children during this age should encourage active play that includes a variety of activity types light moderate or vigorous intensity and aim for at least 3 hours per day schoolaged children and adolescents need at least 60 minutes of moderate tovigorous activity daily to attain the most health benefits from physical activity most activity can be aerobic like walking running or anything that makes their heart beat faster they

intake ranges of the subgroups for grains are represented in daily amounts subgroups for vegetables and protein foods are represented in weekly amounts see figures 32 34 36 and 38 current intakes show that from an early age dietary patterns are not aligned with the dietary guidelines the healthy eating index score of 61 out of 100 for children ages 2 through 4 indicates that overall diet quality is poor notably hei scores decline throughout childhood and adolescence with scores for adolescents approximately 10 points lower than those for young children figure 31 among children ages 2 through 4 consumption of total fruit is generally adequate for about 60 percent of children compared to other age groups a higher percentage of young children also have intakes of total vegetables at or above recommended levels the difference between recommended and actual intakes of total fruit and total vegetables emerges and expands as children age by late adolescence average fruit and vegetable consumption is about half of the recommended range of intake throughout youth starchy vegetables eg white potatoes cornoften in forms that are fried or prepared with additions such as butter and saltare more frequently consumed than the red and orange dark green or beans peas and lentils vegetable subgroups for fruit about 70 percent of intake comes from whole formsfresh canned frozen or

and adolescents is relatively stable across age groups beginning at age 9 the amount of dairy foods in a healthy dietary pattern increases from 2 \u00bd to 3 cup equivalents per day to support an increase in calcium intake that is needed during these life stages as a result average intake of dairy foods is close to or at recommended levels for children younger than age 9 while consumption among adolescents is typically below recommended intake levels although the gaps between recommended and current intakes widen throughout these life stages for some dietary components others principally whole grains and seafood are infrequently consumed by any youth whole grains are consumed below recommended levels even by young children as the difference between recommended and current intakes widens across age groups the types of refined and wholegrain foods consumed remains consistent mixed dishes such as pizza pasta sandwiches burgers and tacos contribute about 50 percent of total grains intake and snacks and sweets such as chips crackers and cookies about 20 percent breakfast cereals and bars including ready toeat and cooked varieties are the top contributor to wholegrains intake during these life stages despite the underconsumption of whole grains intakes of total grains trend toward overconsumption due to the contribution of refined grains total protein intake generally meets targets except for adolescent females ages 14 through 18 youth typically meet or exceed recommendations for meats poultry and eggs seafood a protein subgroup that can support intakes of beneficial fatty acids is consumed at levels far below the lower end of the recommended intakes range when seafood is consumed it is typically as part of a mixed dish rather than as an individual food item children and adolescents can improve intake patterns by maintaining the components of a healthy diet that are evident in early childhood particularly total fruit and dairy foods while increasing consumption of food groups that are underconsumed across all age groups specifically total vegetables and vegetable subgroups whole grains and seafood reducing intakes of added sugars

adolescents special considerations the nutrition considerations for the general us population described in chapter 1 apply to children and adolescents for example due to low intakes of food groups as described above the nutrients of public health concerncalcium vitamin d potassium and dietary fiberapply to these life stages as well although the nutritional needs of youth are remarkably similar to their parents guardians and caregivers these age groups do have some special nutrition considerations specifically increasing intakes of sugarsweetened beverages and decreasing intakes of dairy are dietary components with notable and concerning shifts in consumption throughout youth dietary intake patterns for adolescents particularly females also are an area of special consideration accounting for the areas of dietary improvement that are important for all children and adolescents as well as these special considerations can improve diet quality during a time when food preferences and intake patterns are formed when consistently followed these healthy dietary patterns can provide the foundation for healthy dietary patterns in adulthood promote health among youth and help prevent the onset of chronic disease later in life sugarsweetened beverages sugarsweetened beverages eg soda fruit drinks sports and energy drinks are not necessary in the child or adolescent diet nor are they a component of the usda dietary patterns intake of added sugars increases throughout childhood and adolescence and sugarsweetened beverages are a top contributor as a percent of total daily energy intake average intake of added sugars is 11 percent among young children and peaks at 15 percent during adolescence coinciding with this increase is the contribution of sugarsweetened beverages to total intake of added sugars in childhood sugarsweetened beverages make up about 15 to 25 percent of total added sugars intake by adolescence their contribution is 32 percent and even higher when considering coffee and tea beverages with added sugars an additional 7 percent most sugarsweetened beverages eg soda sports drinks do not contribute to meeting food group goals and often contain a high number of calories decreasing consumption of sugarsweetened beverages to reduce added sugars intake will help youth achieve a healthy dietary pattern beverages that contain no added sugars should be the primary choice for children and adolescents these include water and unsweetened fatfree or lowfat milkincluding lowlactose or lactose free options or fortified soy beverageand 100 juice within recommended amounts consuming beverages with no added sugars is particularly important for young children ages 2 through 8 when only a small number of calories remains for other uses after meeting food group and nutrient needs with nutrientdense choices table 31 the number of calories available for other uses increases slightly as energy needs increase throughout adolescence to support growth and development tables 32 and 33 however most adolescents do not consume foods and beverages in their nutrientdense forms meaning they have few or no calories remaining for added sugars ages 218 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 3 children and adolescents page 88 dairy and fortified soy alternatives throughout childhood and adolescence the types of dairy foods consumed and their contribution to a healthy dietary pattern change milk consumption particularly milk as a beverage is lower and cheese intake typically as part of mixed dishes such as sandwiches pizza or pasta is higher among adolescents when compared to younger children these differences in consumption occur alongside the widening gap between current and recommended intakes of dairy foods that occurs throughout youth nutrientdense options within the dairy group are unsweetened fatfree and lowfat 1 milk yogurt cheese fortified soy beverages and yogurt and lowlactose and lactosefree dairy products dairy and fortified soy alternatives provide protein and a variety of nutrients that are underconsumed during these life stages these include three nutrients of public health concern discussed in chapter 1 potassium calcium and vitamin d the nutrient composition of dairy foods highlights the importance of adequate consumption this is especially relevant for calcium and vitamin d given that adolescents have an increased need for consumption to support the accrual of bone mass adolescent nutrition the difference between recommended food group amounts and current intakes is greater for adolescents ages 14 through 18 than for any other age group across the lifespan as a result adolescents are at greater risk of dietary inadequacy than are other age groups for adolescent males and females low intakes of nutrientdense foods and beverages within the grains dairy and alternatives fruits and vegetables food groups lead to low intakes of phosphorus magnesium and choline adolescent females also consume less meat poultry and eggs than do adolescent males and in combination with low consumption of seafood and other protein subgroups including beans peas and lentils this results in the underconsumption of total protein in addition adolescent females have low dietary intakes of iron folate vitamin b6 and vitamin b12 the potential for nutrient deficiencies existing alongside underconsumption of nutrients of public health concern for all americans creates a concerning constellation of nutritional risks at a time of rapid growth and development along with the onset of puberty menarche and hormonal changes juice many juice products such as fruit drinks contain minimal juice content and are considered sugarsweetened beverages because they are primarily composed of water with added sugars the percent of juice in a beverage may be found on the package label such as contains 25 juice or 100 fruit juice the nutrition facts label identifies the amount of sugars in juice products that are not naturally occurring ie added sugars although 100 fruit juice without added sugars can be part of a healthy dietary pattern it is lower in dietary fiber than whole fruit dietary fiber is a dietary component of public health concern with the recognition that fruit should mostly be consumed in whole forms the amount of fruit juice in the usda food patterns ranges from 4 fluid ounces at the lower calorie levels and no more than 10 fluid ounces at the highest calorie levels ages 218 page 89 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 3 children and adolescents supporting healthy eating the physical mental and emotional changes that occur as children transition from preschool to schoolage and into adolescence come with diverse and changing opportunities to support a healthy dietary pattern support and active engagement from the various people and places involved in the lives of children and adolescents is necessary to help establish and maintain healthy dietary patterns that support healthy weight and the prevention of chronic disease in early childhood parents guardians and caregivers have a primary role in supporting healthy eating because they control the foods and beverages purchased prepared and served exposing young children to a variety of nutrientdense foods within each food group helps build a healthy dietary pattern at an age when taste preferences are acquired introducing children to a variety of nutrientdense foods can be challenging as children grow their search for a sense of autonomy and desire for independence often manifest through selective or picky eating food neophobia or food jags eating only one or a few foods for periods of time offering the same type of food to children multiple times in a variety of forms or prepared in different ways can increase acceptance and intake of healthy foods within food groups for example children may show a dislike for vegetables in the cooked form but accept the raw version or children may only accept fruit when it is cut into small bitesized pieces even with these strategies parents guardians and caregivers of young children should know it may take up to 8 to 10 exposures before a child will accept a new food childrens dietary patterns often resemble those of their household highlighting the importance of their environment in the establishment of a healthy dietary pattern shared meals through shopping cooking and consumption provides parents guardians and caregivers with an opportunity to model healthy eating behaviors and dietary practices by making nutrientdense foods and beverages part of the normal household routine children can observe and learn healthy behaviors that can extend throughout later life stages ideally children continue to be exposed to a healthy dietary pattern as they experience changes to their daily routines such as spending time in child care or school settings as at home eating occasions in these settings can be used as opportunities to support a healthy dietary pattern for example snacks can be used as a way to promote intake of nutrientdense fruits and vegetables like carrot sticks and hummus or apple slices instead of foods like chips or cookies using snacks as an opportunity to encourage nutrientdense food group choices is especially relevant during early childhood when the total volume of food consumed at regular meals is lower and snacking is common when exposed to nutrientdense foods and beverages at an early age and supported in making healthy choices across environments a healthy dietary pattern can be established and maintained as children transition to the adolescence life stage with this transition comes increasing autonomy increased influence of peers and decreased influence of parents guardians and caregivers on food choice as a result foods and beverages are more commonly consumed outside of the home often with a preference for convenience foods that often are not nutrientdense parents guardians and caregivers can continue to support healthy eating during this life stage by providing convenient access to nutrientdense foods involving children and adolescents in meal decisions shopping and cooking and guiding adolescents selection of food purchased and consumed outside the home in schools and community settings healthy eating can be encouraged by creating an environment that makes healthy choices the norm ages 218 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 3 children and adolescents page 90 accessing a healthy dietary pattern many resources exist to support healthy growth and development during childhood and adolescence the following government programs play an essential role in providing access to healthy meals and educational resources to support healthy dietary patterns for all children and adolescents the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap provides temporary benefits to families with qualifying incomes for the purchase of foods and beverages about onehalf of all snap participants are children1 households with young children may be eligible for the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic wic can help families with limited resources meet their childs nutritional needs by providing nutritious foods to supplement diets wic serves children up to the age of 5 years who are at nutritional risk in childcare and afterschool settings the child and adult care food program cacfp can support the development of healthy dietary patterns cacfp is a nutrition program that provides reimbursements for meals and snacks that align with the dietary guidelines to eligible children enrolled at childcare centers daycare homes and in afterschool programs schoolage children can benefit from the national school lunch program and school breakfast program the school meal programs can provide nearly twothirds of daily calories and therefore play an influential role in the development of a healthy dietary pattern outside of the school year the summer food service program sfsp fills the gap by ensuring that children continue to receive nutritious meals when school is not in session the sfsp operates at sites in a community where children can receive nutritious meals in a safe and supervised environment professionals working with youth and their families can use these and additional government and nongovernment resources that exist at the community to support healthy eating during these life stages and to establish the foundation for a healthy dietary pattern that will promote health and support disease prevention in later years looking toward chapter 4 adults this chapter focused on nutrition issues relevant to children and adolescents these issues are particularly important because this life stage encompasses significant transitions from young children who are still dependent on parents guardians and caregivers for all their food choices to adolescents who are highly independent in their food choices diet quality tends to decrease as children mature into adolescence with resulting concerns about underconsumption of nutrients of public health concern establishing and maintaining healthy food and beverages choices now can set a firm foundation for healthy dietary patterns that reduce the risk of dietrelated chronic disease an issue of increasing relevance to adults who are considered in the next chapter 1source characteristics of supplemental nutrition assistance program households fiscal year 2018 available at wwwfnsusdagovsnap

chapter 4 adults introduction t he adult life stage ages 19 through 59 is characterized by independence opportunity and increased responsibility from starting or completing education and training to managing work andor family to planning for the transition to older adulthood balancing work or school responsibilities with personal family or other commitments can create real or perceived barriers to healthy eating constraints on available time and financial resources may make it challenging for adults to adopt and maintain a healthy dietary pattern support for healthy food and beverage choices across the multiple places where adults live work play and gather is needed to improve dietary patterns among adults many individuals enter the adult life stage with an unhealthy dietary pattern already established from the childhood and adolescent years a concerted effort to change this trajectory and support adults in adopting a healthy dietary pattern is needed for better health and to promote the wellbeing of family and friends across life stages learned food and beverage preferences and norms and values placed on diet physical activity and health can positively or negatively influence health because they can determine an individuals willingness to change and maintain behaviors these norms and values including preferences toward certain types of food attitudes about healthy eating and beliefs about the importance of physical activity can extend beyond the individual to larger social networks influencing the behaviors of friends and older or younger family members among adults caring for children role modeling healthy dietary choices is important because the food components of public health concern observed in earlier life stages are similar for adults following a healthy dietary pattern engaging in regular physical activity and managing body weight are critical during this life stage more than onehalf of adults are living with one or more chronic diseasediseases that are often related to poorquality diets and physical inactivity improving dietary patterns in adulthood can play a beneficial role in promoting health and preventing the onset or rate of progression of chronic disease for adults with overweight or obesity making healthful changes to dietary patterns and increasing physical activity will improve health and prevent additional weight gain and or promote weight loss see the importance of physical activity and overweight and obesity adults ages 1959 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 4 adults page 94 the importance of physical activity adults who are physically active are healthier feel better and are less likely to develop many chronic diseases than are adults who are inactive for adults regular physical activity can provide both immediate benefits eg boost mood reduce stress improve sleep and longterm benefits eg improved bone health and reduced risk of many diseases such as cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes depression dementia and many types of cancer adults should move more and sit less throughout the day some physical activity is better than none to attain the most health benefits from physical activity adults need at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity like brisk walking or fast dancing each week adults also need musclestrengthening activity like lifting weights or doing pushups at least 2 days each week the us department of health and human services physical activity guidelines for americans and related move your way resources

overweight or obesity creating an increased risk for the development of other chronic health conditions including cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer losing weight and maintaining weight loss is not a simple task it requires adults to reduce the number of calories they get from foods and beverages and increase the amount expended through physical activity weight loss and maintenance are not likely achieved using shortterm solutions they require a commitment to longterm lifestyle change and often need support from healthcare providers family members and social networks intensive behavioral interventions that use one or more strategieslike group sessions and changes in both diet and physical activitycan be effective for individuals trying to lose a significant amount of weight in addressing obesity professionals should be mindful of health problems stemming from obesityrelated stigma and discrimination the centers for disease control and

dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 4 adults healthy dietary patterns adults are encouraged to follow the recommendations on the types of foods and beverages that make up a healthy dietary pattern described in chapter 1 nutrition and health across the lifespan the guidelines and key recommendations the usda dietary patterns provide a framework of nutrientdense foods and beverages that can be adapted to accommodate budget culture and personal preferences to help adults follow a healthy dietary pattern and meet the guidelines and their key recommendations table 41 displays the healthy usstyle dietary pattern at eight calorie levels that are appropriate for most adults ages 19 through 59 years to illustrate the specific amounts and limits for food groups and other dietary components that make up healthy dietary patterns in general calorie needs are lower for females compared to males calorie needs decline throughout adulthood due to changes in metabolism that accompany aging level of physical activity body composition and the presence of chronic disease are additional factors that affect calorie needs females ages 19 through 30 require about 1800 to 2400 calories a day males in this age group have higher calorie needs of about 2400 to 3000 a day calorie needs for adults ages 31 through 59 are generally lower most females require about 1600 to 2200 calories a day and males require about 2200 to 3000 calories a day additional information on these estimates is provided in table 41 footnote a and in appendix 2 estimated calorie needs the usda

considerations the dietary considerations for the general us population including adults are described in chapter 1 the following sections of this chapter focus on several special considerations to support a healthy dietary pattern for adults that reflect adults current intake patterns and the prevalence of overweight and obesity and dietrelated chronic disease that become more apparent in this life stage these considerations include a focus on dietary changes to increase intakes of dietary fiber calcium and vitamin d and to decrease intakes of added sugars saturated fat and sodium special considerations related to alcoholic beverages also are discussed dietary fiber dietary patterns that do not meet recommended intakes of fruits vegetables and whole grains contribute to low intakes of dietary fiber more than 90 percent of women and 97 percent of men do not meet recommended intakes for dietary fiber this aligns with intake patterns where fruits vegetables and whole grains are underconsumed by more than 85 percent of adults appendix 1 nutritional goals for agesex groups provides dietary fiber goals for men and women based on the dietary reference intakes these recommendations are based on levels observed to reduce risk of coronary heart disease increasing intakes of fruits vegetables and replacing refined grains with whole grains to improve dietary fiber intakes is especially important during this life stage as the impact of poor diet quality becomes apparent with the onset andor progression of dietrelated chronic diseases chapter 1 provides strategies on how to increase intakes of these important food groups a list of common food sources of dietary fiber is available at dietaryguidelinesgov calcium and vitamin d calcium and vitamin d are important at any age and most adults do not consume adequate amounts close to 30 percent of men and 60 percent of women older than age 19 years do not consume enough calcium and more than 90 percent do not consume enough vitamin d dietary patterns that do not meet recommended intake amounts for food groups and subgroups which include sources of calcium and vitamin dsuch as dairy foods and fortified soy alternatives and seafoodcontribute to low intake of these nutrients particular attention should be given to consuming adequate amounts of foods with these nutrients during adult years to promote optimal bone health and prevent the onset of osteoporosis adequate intake of calcium and vitamin d is particularly important for adults during the time period when peak bone mass is still actively accruing ages 19 through about 30 and for women in the postmenopausal period when rapid bone remodeling occurs a healthy dietary pattern with nutrientdense calciumrich foods such as lowfat milk and yogurt and fortified soy alternatives and canned sardines and salmon can help adults better meet intake recommendations vitamin d aids in the absorption of calcium consuming the recommended amount of seafood and choosing foods that are fortified with vitamin d including milk fortified soy beverages and fortified soy yogurt and some wholegrain cereals can help adults meet their needs in addition to dietary sources the body can make vitamin d from the adults ages 1959 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 4 adults page 102 sun however some individuals may have difficulty producing sufficient vitamin d from sunlight exposure or consuming enough vitamin d from foods and beverages so a supplement may be recommended by a health professional appendix 1 provides calcium and vitamin d goals for men and women based on the dietary reference intakes a list of common food sources of calcium and vitamin d is available at dietaryguidelinesgov saturated fat chapter 1 explains the importance of limiting intakes of saturated fat to support healthy dietary patterns staying within saturated fat limits and replacing saturated fat with unsaturated fat is of particular importance during the adult life stage the prevalence of coronary heart disease increases with age and high ldl cholesterol peaks between the ages of 50 to 59 in men and 60 to 69 in women about 70 to 75 percent of adults exceed the 10percent limit on saturated fat as a result of selecting foods and beverages across food groups that are not in nutrient dense forms the top sources of saturated fat for adults are sandwiches eg deli sandwiches burgers tacos burritos grilled cheese hot dogs and other grainbased mixed dishes eg spaghetti and meatballs casseroles quesadillas that typically contain ingredients from several food groups that are not in nutrientdense forms including grains protein foods and dairy making changes to the type of ingredients as well as amount andor frequency of their consumption will help adults lower saturated fat intake without a need to eliminate these foods from the household diet strategies include using lean meats and lowfat cheese to prepare these foods or substituting beans in place of meats as the protein source saturated fat also can be reduced by substituting certain ingredients with sources of unsaturated fat eg using avocado nuts or seeds in a dish instead of cheese cooking with oils higher in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat eg canola corn olive peanut safflower soybean and sunflower instead of butter also can reduce intakes of saturated fat sodium the number of adults exceeding the chronic disease risk reduction level for sodium see chapter 1 or appendix 1 during this life stage is concerning given that 45 percent of adults ages 18 and older are living with hypertension during adulthood prevalence of hypertension increases from about 22 percent of adults ages 18 through 39 to about 55 percent of adults ages 40 through 591 changing this trend is important because hypertension is a preventable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and stroke unlike other factors that cannot be changed such as genetics and family history reduced dietary intake of sodium is a modifiable risk factor that can help improve blood pressure control and reduce risk of hypertension overconsumption of sodium occurs for several reasons as discussed in chapter 1 because sodium is found in foods and beverages across all food groups with most coming from foods that have salt added during commercial processing rather than salt added to foods during or after preparation reducing sodium consumption will require a joint effort by individuals the food and beverage industry and food service and retail establishments 1 ostchega y fryar cd nwankwo t

dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 4 adults added sugars most adults exceed recommended limits for added sugars as a result of eating foods and drinking beverages higher in added sugars and selecting foods and beverages across food groups that are not in nutrientdense forms added sugars are of particular concern for adults because exceeding limits contributes to excess calorie intake beverages as a source of added sugars sugarsweetened beverages eg soda sports drinks energy drinks fruit drinks and sweetened coffees and teas including readytodrink varieties contribute over 40 percent of daily intake of added sugars more than in earlier life stages adults consume coffees and teas with additions such as sugar and flavored syrup frequent consumption of these and other beverages containing added sugars can contribute to excess calorie intake some sugarsweetened beverages such as coffee and tea with milk contribute to food group intake eg dairy and can be made without added sugars others such as fruit drinks can be replaced with nutrientdense options such as 100 juice to help meet fruit group recommendations most adults diets include choices across multiple food groups that are not in nutrientdense forms and therefore cannot accommodate excess calories from sweetened beverages intake of sugarsweetened beverages should be limited to small amounts and most often replaced with beverage options that contain no added sugars such as water other sources of added sugars a variety of foods and beverages contribute to the remaining added sugars consumed by adults in addition to the contribution of sugarsweetened beverages and sweetened coffees and teas about 30 percent come from desserts and sweet snacks candies and sweetened breakfast cereals the remaining 30 percent of added sugars is consumed in relatively small amounts across many food categories as discussed in chapter 1 many of these food categories have seen market expansion in recent years for example over the past decade beverages snacks and bakery foods have continuously topped the list for the most new product introductions2 as these and other food categories continue to change and expand it is vital for individuals to learn how to identify the amount of added sugars in a beverage or food product by reading the nutrition facts label see chapter 1 understanding which food choices contribute to intakes of added sugars without contributing to nutrient needs can help individuals remove or replace these foods with better choices that meet food group and nutrient recommendations within calorie needs 2 additional information is available at ersusdagovtopicsfoodmarketspricesprocessingmarketingnewproductsaspx adults ages 1959 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 4 adults page 104 alcoholic beverages alcoholic beverages are not a component of the usda dietary patterns and their calories are considered discretionary regular consumption of alcoholic beverages can make it challenging for adults to meet food group and nutrient needs while not consuming excess calories the ingredients in certain mixed drinks including soda mixers and heavy cream also can contribute to intake of added sugars and saturated fat the majority of us adults consume alcoholic beverages about 66 percent of adults ages 21 through 59 report alcoholic beverage consumption in the past month and of those approximately half report binge drinking sometimes multiple times per month among adults who choose to drink average intakes of calories from alcoholic beverages exceed the remaining calorie limit that is available after food group recommendations are met there are some adults who should not drink alcoholic beverages at all such as if they are pregnant or might be pregnant younger than age 21 or recovering from an alcohol use disorder or if they are unable to control the amount they drink for those who choose to drink intakes should be limited to 1 drink or less in a day for women and 2 drinks or less in a day for men on days when alcohol is consumed more information in available in chapter 1 under alcoholic beverages supporting healthy eating individuals need support in making healthy choices at home work and in the community to build healthy dietary patterns food retail outlets eg grocery stores convenience stores restaurants provide adults with the option to purchase ingredients to prepare foods themselves or to purchase foods prepared by others national food expenditures suggest the purchase of prepared foods is a regular habit for most adults with expenditures outpacing those of foods purchased for household meal preparation3 estimates also suggest that the younger generation of american adults are spending an even larger proportion of their total food dollars on prepared foods than are older generations4 when adults prepare meals themselves they have more control over the types of food ingredients selected and can focus on choosing nutrientdense options that contribute to food group goals with little or no added sugars and saturated fat and less sodium the same is not always true when purchasing prepared foods despite changes and innovation in the marketplace such as menu and product labeling or reformulation for some adults preparing and consuming healthy meals at home will mean adopting a new habit andor learning new skills such as meal planning for others it may entail small changes to current routines planning meals and snacks in advance with food groups and nutrientdense foods and beverages in mind can support healthy eating at home and improve dietary patterns of individuals and families preparing meals with family and friends also presents an opportunity for greater connection and enjoyment around food for adults who are parents guardians or caregivers of children or adolescents preparing meals also provides an opportunity to teach valuable cooking skills and model behaviors that support the adoption of healthy dietary patterns across younger life stages 3 details are available at ersusdagovwebdocspublications96957ap083pdfv58483

dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 4 adults it is not realistic or desirable to avoid the purchase and consumption of foods prepared by others limits on available time and the desire for convenience make restaurant and readytoeat meals a part of many household routines many of these settings also provide for social enjoyment of food with friends and family however foods prepared outside of the home can contribute to the overconsumption of calories as a result of large portion sizes and methods of preparation being mindful of the portion sizes and ingredients of prepared foods can help adults achieve a healthy dietary pattern while still enjoying foods prepared by others health promotion activities that center on increasing consumer knowledge and access to healthy options in the places where americans purchase prepared foods are needed to provide support for adults in these efforts health professionals play an important role in supporting adults healthy eating behaviors helping adults become more aware of the foods and beverages that make up their typical dietary patterns and identifying areas for improvement can empower individuals to make changes to the types of foods they purchase or prepare teaching skills like cooking and meal planning and helping adults understand how to read labels or make healthy menu substitutions also will support the adoption of a healthy dietary pattern during this life stage in settings where adults spend their time changing organizational practices approaches andor policies to support improved dietary patterns also is needed strategies include offering healthy meals and snacks in workplace cafeterias and vending machines or implementing educational programs tailored to working adults or communities can support farmers markets community gardens and related educational programming efforts accessing a healthy dietary pattern a healthy dietary pattern can only be achieved when adequate resources and supports exist in the places where adults live work and gather food access is crucial for adults to achieve a healthy dietary pattern and is influenced by diverse factors as discussed in chapter 1 food insecurity which occurs when access to nutritionally adequate and safe food is limited or uncertain is most prevalent in households with children and in singleparent households income is one of the primary characteristics associated with food insecurity government programs such as the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap or the food distribution program on indian reservations fdpir serve as a resource for lowincome adults by supplementing food budgets to support healthy lifestyles adults with children or those caring for older family members also may benefit from resources discussed in chapters 2 3 and 6 additional government and nongovernment resources such as food banks or community meal sites and programming offered through snap education snaped and the expanded food and nutrition education program efnep play a role in providing food and educational resources to support adults in making healthy food choices within a limited budget innovative approaches to support health such as incentive programs at farmers markets or healthy cornerstore initiatives continue to expand continued attention and creativity in approaches to expand food access are needed to support a healthy dietary pattern for adults and the larger social networks that they influence learn more the federal foodservice guidelines is a resource that food service providers can use to help make

20202025 chapter 4 adults page 106 looking toward chapter 5 women who are pregnant or lactating and chapter 6 older adults this chapter has discussed the importance of a healthy dietary pattern and related special considerations during the adult life stage the chapter recognizes that dietary patterns are generally well established by the time individuals reach adulthood and encourages adults to take advantage of the many opportunities available to make changes that support a healthy dietary pattern making these changes can have important benefits for achieving a healthy weight status reducing chronic disease risk and promoting overall health these considerations are especially important for the life stages discussed in the next two chapters chapter 5 takes a closer look at a special time in the life of many adultspregnancy and lactation this chapter echoes the same guidance for adults on following a healthy dietary pattern and discusses several special considerations that arise during this life stage chapter 6 then makes the transition from the adults chapter to a focused look at healthy eating for older adults women who are pregnant or lactating women who are pregnant

pregnant or lactating women who are pregnant or lactating page 109 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 5 women who are pregnant or lactating introduction p regnancy and lactation are special stages of life for women and nutrition plays a vital role before during and after these life stages to support the health of the mother and her child following a healthy dietary pattern is especially important for those who are pregnant or lactating for several reasons increased calorie and nutrient intakes are necessary to support the growth and development of the baby and to maintain the mothers health consuming a healthy dietary pattern before and during pregnancy also may improve pregnancy outcomes in addition following a healthy dietary pattern before and during pregnancy and lactation has the potential to affect health outcomes for both the mother and child in subsequent life stages this chapter addresses some important nutritional considerations for women before pregnancy and contains nutrition guidance for women during pregnancy and lactation a healthy dietary pattern along with changing calorie and nutrient needs during pregnancy and lactation are described throughout the chapter special consideration is given to the importance of achieving and maintaining a healthy weight before pregnancy gaining weight within gestational weight gain guidelines and returning to a healthy weight during the postpartum period a healthy weight status during these life stages has short and longterm health benefits for the mother and her child the chapter also discusses other considerations important to pregnancy and lactation including those related to intake of seafood alcohol and caffeinated beverages finally during pregnancy nausea vomiting food aversions and food cravings can make it difficult for some women to achieve optimal dietary intake the chapter discusses how these can be considered when helping women who are pregnant or lactating make healthy food and beverage choices women who are pregnant or lactating dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 5 women who are pregnant or lactating page 110 healthy dietary patterns women who are pregnant or lactating are encouraged to follow the recommendations on the types of foods and beverages that make up a healthy dietary pattern described in chapter 1 nutrition and health across the lifespan the dietary guidelines and key recommendations the core elements of a healthy diet for women during these life stages are similar to the recommendations for women who are not pregnant table 51 shows the healthy usstyle dietary pattern to illustrate the specific amounts and limits for food groups and other dietary components that make up healthy dietary patterns at the six calorie levels most relevant to women who are pregnant or lactating following a healthy dietary pattern during these life stages can help women meet the guidelines and its key recommendations the usda dietary patterns are discussed in greater detail in chapter 1 and appendix 3 usda dietary patterns table 52 summarizes estimated daily calorie needs during pregnancy and lactation compared to prepregnancy needs for women with a healthy prepregnancy weight additional information on estimates of prepregnancy calorie needs is provided in table 51 footnote a and in appendix 2 estimated calorie needs as shown in table 52 calorie needs generally increase as pregnancy progresses and remain elevated during lactation however it is important to note that women with a prepregnancy weight that is considered overweight or obese have lower weight gain recommendations than do women with a healthy prepregnancy weight see weight management women should follow their healthcare providers guidance regarding appropriate caloric intake during pregnancy and lactation as many factors including prepregnancy weight status gestational weight gain and multiple pregnancies may affect calorie needs in general it is important for women who are pregnant to be under the care of a healthcare provider who can monitor their health status and the progress of their pregnancy the increased calorie and nutrient needs for these life stages should be met by consuming nutrientdense food choices as part of a healthy dietary pattern one way to achieve this is to follow the healthy usstyle dietary pattern throughout pregnancy and lactation but adjust intake of food groups to reflect higher calorie patterns recommended during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and throughout lactation in short women should meet their increased calorie and nutrient needs with nutrientdense foods instead of with foods high in added sugars saturated fat and sodium the customizable components of the usda dietary patterns provide flexibility that allows womenor professionals adapting these patternsto choose from a variety of foods and beverages within each food group to suit individual preference lifestyle traditions culture and budget this flexibility in being able to select among a variety of nutrientdense options is particularly important for women who experience pregnancyinduced nausea vomiting or food aversions when making food and beverage choices women should know that unless its medically indicated to avoid for her own health women do not need to restrict their choices during pregnancy or lactation to prevent food allergy from developing in their child however women who are pregnant should pay attention to some important food safety considerations see food safety during pregnancy nutrientdense foods and beverages nutrientdense foods and beverages provide vitamins minerals and other healthpromoting components and have little added sugars saturated fat and sodium

retain 20 pounds or more at 12 months postpartum postpartum weight retention results in about 1 in 7 women moving from a healthy weight classification before pregnancy to an overweight classification postpartum current estimates show that about half of women of childbearing age have a weight classification of overweight or obese women with overweight or obesity frequently exceed gestational weight

public health concerncalcium vitamin d potassium and dietary fiberapply to these life stages as well in addition iron is a nutrient of public health concern for women who are pregnant these life stages also have some special nutrient and dietary considerations regarding folate iodine choline seafood alcoholic beverages and caffeinated beverages that are discussed in the following sections of this chapter meeting nutrient needs as discussed in chapter 1 nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods and beverages however this may be difficult for some women especially those who are pregnant most healthcare providers recommend women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant take a daily prenatal vitamin and mineral supplement in addition to consuming a healthy dietary pattern this may be especially important to meet folatefolic acid iron iodine and vitamin d needs during pregnancy see appendix 1 nutritional goals for agesex groups nutrient needs for women who are lactating differ from those who are pregnant continued use of prenatal supplements by women who are lactating may exceed their needs for folic acid and iron women who are lactating should not exceed the tolerable upper intake level ul of 1000 micrograms of folic acid and 45 milligrams of iron women should seek guidance from a healthcare provider on appropriate use of prenatal or other dietary supplements during lactation folatefolic acid the rda for folate is higher during pregnancy and lactation than all other life stages see appendix 1 adequate folic acid intake is particularly important prior to conception and during the first trimester to help prevent neural tube defects the united states preventative services task force uspstf recommends that all women who are planning or capable of pregnancy take a daily supplement containing 400 to 800 mcg of folic acid the critical period for supplementation starts at least 1 month before conception and continues through the first 2 to 3 months of pregnancy dietary supplements may contain either folic acid or 5methyltetrahydrofolate 5mthf but only folic acid has been shown to prevent neural tube defects most prenatal supplements sold in the united states contain folic acid the recommendation for folic acid supplementation is in addition to the amounts of food folate contained in a healthy eating pattern folate is found inherently in darkgreen vegetables and beans peas and lentils all enriched grains ie bread pasta rice and cereal and some corn masa flours are fortified with folic acid iron iron needs increase during pregnancy compared to prepregnancy for women who are lactating before menstruation returns iron needs fall and then return to prepregnancy levels once menstruation resumes see appendix 1 iron is a key nutrient during pregnancy that supports fetal development iron deficiency affects about 1 in 10 women who are pregnant and 1 in 4 women during their third trimester heme iron which is found in animal source foods eg lean meats poultry and some seafood is more readily absorbed by the body than the nonheme iron found in plant source foods eg beans peas lentils and darkgreen vegetables additional iron sources include foods enriched or fortified with iron such as many wholewheat breads and readytoeat women who are pregnant or lactating dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 5 women who are pregnant or lactating page 116 cereals absorption of iron from nonheme sources is enhanced by consuming them along with vitamin crich foods food source lists for both heme and nonheme iron are available at dietaryguidelinesgov women who are pregnant or who are planning to become pregnant are advised to take a supplement containing iron when recommended by an obstetrician or other healthcare provider more than half of women continue to use prenatal supplements during lactation most prenatal supplements are designed to meet the higher iron needs of pregnancy depending on various factorssuch as when menstruation returnsprenatal supplements may exceed the iron needs of women who are lactating women should seek guidance from a healthcare provider regarding the appropriate level of iron supplementation during lactation based on their unique needs iodine iodine needs increase substantially during pregnancy and lactation see appendix 1 adequate iodine intake during pregnancy is important for neurocognitive development of the fetus although women of reproductive age generally have adequate iodine intake some women particularly those who do not regularly consume dairy products eggs seafood or use iodized table salt may not consume enough iodine to meet increased needs during pregnancy and lactation women who are pregnant or lactating should not be encouraged to start using table salt if they do not do so already however they should ensure that any table salt used in cooking or added to food at the table is iodized additionally women who are pregnant or lactating may need a supplement containing iodine in order to achieve adequate intake many prenatal supplements do not contain iodine thus it is important to read the label vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns during pregnancy and lactation women following a vegetarian or vegan dietary pattern during these life stages may need to take special care to ensure nutrient adequacy iron may be of particular concern because plant source foods only contain nonheme iron which is less bioavailable than heme iron food source lists for both heme and nonheme iron are available at dietaryguidelinesgov vitamin b12 also is of concern because it is present only in animal source foods women following a vegetarian or vegan dietary pattern should consult with a healthcare provider to determine whether supplementation of iron vitamin b12 andor other nutrients such as choline zinc iodine or epadha is necessary and if so the appropriate levels to meet their unique needs women who are pregnant or lactating page 117 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 5 women who are pregnant or lactating choline choline needs also increase during pregnancy and lactation see appendix 1 adequate intake of choline during these life stages helps to both replenish maternal stores and support the growth and development of the childs brain and spinal cord most women do not meet recommended intakes of choline during pregnancy and lactation women are encouraged to consume a variety of cholinecontaining foods during these life stages choline can be found throughout many food groups and subgroups meeting recommended intakes for the dairy and protein food groupswith eggs meats and some seafood being notable sourcesas well as the beans peas and lentils subgroup can help meet choline needs meeting nutrient needs through foods and beverages is preferred but women who are concerned about meeting recommendations should speak with their healthcare provider to determine whether choline supplementation is appropriate many prenatal supplements do not contain choline or only contain small amounts inadequate to meet recommendations seafood seafood intake during pregnancy is recommended as it is associated with favorable measures of cognitive development in young children women who are pregnant or lactating should consume at least 8 and up to 12 ounces of a variety of seafood per week from choices lower in methylmercury the us food and drug administration fda and the us environmental protection agency epa provide joint advice regarding seafood consumption to limit methylmercury exposure for women who might become or who are pregnant or lactating methylmercury can be harmful to the brain and nervous system if a person is exposed to too much of it over time this is particularly important during pregnancy because eating too much of it can have negative effects on the developing fetus based on fda and epas advice depending on body weight some women should choose seafood lowest in methylmercury or eat less seafood than the amounts in the healthy usstyle dietary pattern additionally certain species of seafood eg shark swordfish king mackerel should be avoided during pregnancy more information is available on the fda or epa websites at fdagovfishadvice and epagovfishadvice alcoholic beverages women who are or who may be pregnant should not drink alcohol however consumption of alcohol during pregnancy continues to be of concern in the united states among women who are pregnant about 1 in 10 reported consuming alcohol during the past month with an average intake of 2 or more drink equivalents on days alcohol is consumed it is not safe for women to drink any type or amount of alcohol during pregnancy women who drink alcohol and become pregnant should stop drinking immediately and women who are trying to become pregnant should women who are pregnant or lactating dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 5 women who are pregnant or lactating page 118 not drink at all alcohol can harm the baby at any time during pregnancy even during the first or second month when a woman may not know she is pregnant not drinking alcohol also is the safest option for women who are lactating generally moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages by a woman who is lactating up to 1 standard drink in a day is not known to be harmful to the infant especially if the woman waits at least 2 hours after a single drink before nursing or expressing breast milk additional information on breastfeeding and alcohol can be found at

women who could be or who are pregnant should consult their healthcare providers for advice concerning caffeine consumption food safety during pregnancy women who are pregnant and their unborn children are more susceptible than are the general population to the effects of foodborne illnesses such as listeriosis they need to take special care to keep foods safe and to not eat foods that increase the risk of foodborne illness during pregnancy women should only eat foods containing seafood meats poultry or eggs that have been cooked to recommended safe minimum internal temperatures they also should take special precautions not to consume unpasteurized raw juice or milk raw sprouts or some soft cheeses made from unpasteurized milk deli and luncheon meats and hot dogs should be

the mother and the baby physical activity increases or maintains cardiorespiratory fitness and reduces the risk of excessive weight gain and gestational diabetes for many benefits healthy women without contraindications should do a least 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity a week as they are able women who habitually did vigorousintensity activity or a lot of aerobic or musclestrengthening physical activity before pregnancy can continue to do so during pregnancy women can consult their healthcare provider about whether or how to adjust their physical activity during pregnancy postpartum physical activity following the birth of a child continues to benefit a womans overall health physical activity during the postpartum period increases cardiorespiratory fitness improves mood and reduces the symptoms of postpartum depression additionally physical activity can help achieve and maintain a healthy weight and when combined with caloric restriction helps promote weight loss women should start slow and build back up to more activity over time women should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderateintensity aerobic activity a week the us department of health and

increased interest in and motivation to make healthy lifestyle changes during pregnancy and lactation furthermore the dietary choices made during these life stages can affect womens health and the health of their children supporting women in adopting healthy dietary patterns during this important time of life and sustaining them thereafter also enables them to serve as role models when their children begin transitioning to complementary foods women who are pregnant or lactating face many real or perceived barriers when trying to meet the recommendations of the dietary guidelines constraints on time and financial resources limited access to high quality childcare and family leave policies as well as inadequate breastfeeding support at home or at work are barriers women may face these barriers should be considered by all those who support women in their efforts to follow a healthy dietary pattern ensuring women have access to healthy safe food is vital due to the critical role nutrition plays in health promotion during these life stages this is particularly critical for families dealing with food insecurity which is most prevalent in households with children and in singleparent households participation in federal programs such as the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic which serves lowincome pregnant breastfeeding and nonbreastfeeding postpartum women and infants and children up to age 5 can help alleviate these challenges and improve dietary intake for many women and children facing economic hardship the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap and the food distribution program on indian reservations fdpir can also serve as resources for lowincome women and their families by both supplementing food budgets to support health and by providing nutrition education through the snaped program additionally usdas healthy eating on a budget1 can help women and families plan and prepare healthy inexpensive meals other government and nongovernment resources such as food banks or community meal programs also provide food and educational resources that can support women in making healthy food choices for themselves and their families support during lactation can help women meet their breastfeeding goals despite significant demands on their time and energy during this life stage worksite programs and policies that allow women adequate time to pump breast milk when away from their child as well as access to good quality childcare can allow women who return to work to achieve breastfeeding goals access to breastfeeding peer counselors such as those used in wic or free breastfeeding support groups through local hospitals also can support women during this life stage

number of health and social changes that affect this populations nutritional status compared to younger adults older adults are at greater risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer as well as health conditions related to changes in bone and muscle mass such as osteoporosis and sarcopenia respectively an increasing number of older adults start this life stage with excess body weight preventing additional weight gain and achieving a healthy weight by following a healthy dietary pattern and adopting an active lifestyle can support healthy aging selecting healthy food and beverage choices is important for people throughout this life stage regardless of their race or ethnicity or their current health status it is never too late to make improvements older adults should follow a healthy dietary pattern because of the changing dietary needs and the heightened risk of malnutrition that occurs with age older adults generally have lower calorie needs but similar or even increased nutrient needs compared to younger adults the overall nutrient density of dietary patterns is particularly important to this age group lower calorie needs result from less physical activity changes in metabolism andor agerelated loss in bone and muscle mass other factors may affect nutrient needs and absorption of nutrients in older adults including chronic disease and conditions use of multiple medications and changes in body composition the healthy dietary patterns described below take the unique needs of older adults into account and are further supported by special considerations and strategies for professionals to support healthy aging nutrientdense foods and beverages nutrientdense foods and beverages provide vitamins minerals and other health

described in chapter 1 apply to older adults for example the nutrients of public concern calcium vitamin d potassium and dietary fiberapply to this age group as well however this age group also has some special nutrition considerations that are discussed in the following sections of this chapter for example several additional nutrients are more likely to be underconsumed during this life stage these include dietary protein and vitamin b12 beverage intake particularly as it relates to hydration status also is an area of special consideration protein consuming enough protein is important to prevent the loss of lean muscle mass that occurs naturally with age monitoring protein intake is especially important as older adults transition through this life stage intake patterns show average intakes of protein foods is lower for individuals ages 71 and older compared to adults ages 60 through 70 about 50 percent of women and 30 percent of men 71 and older fall short of protein foods recommendations the majority of protein in the healthy usstyle dietary pattern is accounted for in the protein foods subgroups seafood meats poultry and eggs nuts seeds and soy products and the vegetable subgroup of beans peas and lentils which also is considered a protein foods subgroup the dairy and fortified soy alternatives food group is another source of dietary protein most older adults are meeting or exceeding weekly recommendations for meats poultry and eggs making this subgroup a common source of protein foods for older adults table 61 however seafood dairy and fortified soy alternatives and beans peas and lentils are underconsumed yet provide important nutrients that support healthy dietary patterns for example the dairy food group provides calcium vitamin d and vitamin b12 and the beans peas and lentils subgroup provides dietary fiber many choices within the seafood subgroup also provide vitamins d and b12 and calcium if eaten with bones and beneficial fatty acids food sources of calcium vitamin d and dietary fiber are available at dietaryguidelinesgov many older adults can improve their dietary pattern and better meet nutrient needs by choosing from a wider variety of protein sources in some cases this may mean using seafood more often in place of meats poultry or eggs or using beans peas and lentils in mixed dishes such as soups rice or pasta dishes for others it may mean maintaining current intakes of protein and finding enjoyable ways to add protein foods from underconsumed food groups and subgroups in order to ensure that overall protein needs are met vitamin b12 vitamin b12 is of concern for some older adults because the ability to absorb this nutrient can decrease with age and use of certain medications can decrease absorption older adults are encouraged to meet the recommendations for protein foods a common source of vitamin b12 and include foods fortified with vitamin b12 such as breakfast cereals some individuals also may require vitamin b12 dietary supplements individuals are encouraged to speak with their healthcare provider to determine what if any supplementation is appropriate dietary supplements many adults in the united states take one or more dietary supplements either as a pill or drink popular supplements include some nutrients that are underconsumed among older adults including calcium and vitamins d and b12 all sources of a nutrient or food componentwhether from food or a dietary supplementshould be considered when assessing an individuals dietary pattern including any added sugars that may come from supplement drinks older adults should track and discuss all dietary supplement use with their healthcare provider beverage supplements should not replace regular food intake unless instructed by a health professional the national institutes of health office of dietary supplements provides the my dietary supplement and medicine record1 to help

older adults beverages many older adults do not drink enough fluids to stay hydrated one reason for this is that the sensation of thirst tends to decline with age concerns about bladder control or issues with mobility also may hinder intake of fluids among older adults mean intakes of beverages show adults ages 60 and older consume significantly fewer fluid ounces across all beverage types compared to adults ages 59 and underabout 2 fewer cups per day most of which is due to drinking less water it is important that older adults drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration and aid in the digestion of food and absorption of nutrients in addition to water choosing unsweetened beverages such as 100 fruit or vegetable juice and lowfat or fatfree milk or fortified soy beverage can support fluid intake to prevent dehydration while helping to achieve food group recommendations the water that is contained in foods such as fruits vegetables and soups contributes to hydration status and is a contributor to total fluid intake alcoholic beverages the dietary guidelines do not recommend initiating alcohol consumption for any reason to help older adults move toward a healthy dietary pattern and minimize risks associated with drinking older adults can choose not to drink or drink in moderationlimiting intakes to 2 drinks or less in a day for men and 1 drink or less in a day for women when alcohol is consumed older adults who choose to drink may experience the effects of alcohol more quickly than they did when they were younger this puts older adults at higher risk of falls car crashes and other injuries that may result from drinking in addition older adults tend to have a greater number of comorbid health conditions than younger adults and alcohol use or misuse may adversely affect the condition or interfere with management of the disease certain older adults should avoid drinking alcohol completely including those who plan to drive or operate machinery or participate in activities that require skill coordination and alertness take certain overthecounter or prescription medications have certain medical conditions are recovering from alcohol use disorder or are unable to control the amount they drink more information on alcoholic beverages and their relationship to health is provided in chapter 1 supporting healthy eating similar to other life stages older adults can be supported by professionals family and friends to achieve a healthy dietary pattern that accounts for factors such as cost preferences traditions and access additional factors to consider when supporting healthy eating for older adults include enjoyment of food sharing meals with friends and family can help increase food enjoyment and promote adequacy of dietary intake for older adults ability to chew or swallow foods experimenting with the preparation of foods from all food groups can help identify textures that are acceptable appealing and enjoyable for adults who have difficulties chewing or swallowing good dental health is critical to overall health as well as the ability to chew foods properly food safety practicing safe food handling procedures is of particular

2002 the total number of calories a person needs each day varies depending on the persons age sex height weight and level of physical activity in addition a need to lose maintain or gain weight and other factors affect how many calories should be consumed estimated amounts of calories needed to maintain energy balance for various age and sex groups at three different levels of physical activity are provided in table a21 for toddlers ages 12 through 23 months and table a22 for ages 2 and older these estimates are based on the estimated energy requirements eer equations using reference heights average and reference weights healthy for each agesex group for toddlers children and adolescents reference height and weight vary by age for adults the reference man is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 154 pounds the reference woman is 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighs 126 pounds estimates range from 700 to 1000 calories for toddlers ages 12 through 23 months estimated needs for young children ages 2 through 8 range from 1000 to 2000 calories a wider range of 1400 to 3200 calories is estimated for older children and adolescents with males generally having higher calorie needs than females adult estimated calorie needs range from 1600 to 2400 calories per day for females and 2000 to 3000 calories per day for males as shown males generally require more calories than females due to reductions in basal metabolic rate that occur with aging calorie needs generally decrease for adults as they age estimated calorie needs during the first trimester of pregnancy generally do not increase compared to prepregnancy needs additional calories needed for the later trimesters of pregnancy and during lactation are outlined in table a23 and include approximately 300 to 400 additional calories it is recommended that women follow their healthcare providers guidance regarding appropriate caloric intake during pregnancy as many factors including prepregnancy weight status gestational weight gain and multiple pregnancies may affect calorie needs women with overweight or obesity have lower recommended gestational weight gain during pregnancy which may affect calorie needs these calorie needs are only estimates and approximations of individual calorie needs can be determined with online tools the dri calculator for healthcare professionals available at

tables a31 and a32 is based on the types and proportions of foods americans typically consume but in nutrientdense forms and appropriate amounts the healthy vegetarian dietary pattern tables a33 and a34 and the healthy mediterraneanstyle dietary pattern table a35 are variations that also exemplify a healthy dietary pattern for the first time the healthy usstyle and healthy vegetarian dietary patterns are provided for toddlers ages 12 through 23 months who are no longer receiving human milk or infant formula these patterns are designed to meet nutrient needs while not exceeding calorie requirements and while staying within limits for overconsumed dietary components such as added sugars saturated fat and sodium the methodology used to develop and update these patterns builds on the rich history usda has in developing food guides this methodology includes using current food consumption data to determine the mix and proportions of foods to include in each group food composition data is used to select a nutrientdense representative for each food and calculate nutrient profiles for each food group as would be expected most foods in their nutrientdense forms do contain some sodium and saturated fat in a few cases such as in the case of wholewheat bread the most appropriate representative in current federal databases contains a small amount of added sugars detailed information about the representative foods nutrient profiles and patterns is available in the online appendix of the scientific report of the 2020 dietary guidelines advisory committee1 amounts of each food group and subgroup within the patterns are based on nutrient and dietary guidelines standards see appendix 1 nutritional goals for agesex groups standards for nutrient adequacy aim to meet the recommended dietary allowances rda which are designed to cover the needs of 97 percent of the population and adequate intakes ai which are used when an average nutrient requirement cannot be determined the patterns meet these standards for almost all nutrients for a few nutrients vitamin d and vitamin e for all ages and choline for ages 2 and older amounts in the patterns are marginal or below the rda or ai standard for many or all agesex groups in most cases an intake of these nutrients below the rda or ai is not considered to be of public health concern for more information on dietary components of public health concern see chapter 1 the patterns have 12 calorie levels to meet the needs of individuals across the lifespan ages 2 and older for toddlers ages 12 through 23 months who are no longer receiving either human milk or infant formula the patterns are provided at 4 calorie levels chapters 2 3 4 5 and 6 describe healthy dietary patterns and relevant calorie levels for each life stage to follow these patterns identify the appropriate calorie level choose a variety of foods in each group and subgroup over time in recommended amounts and limit choices that

to present the dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 this edition marks the first time the guidelines provide recommendations by life stage from birth through older adulthood each stage of life is distinct and has unique needs that affect health and disease risk early food preferences influence food and beverage choices later and the science has evolved to focus on the importance of a healthy dietary pattern over time the science also shows its never too late to start and maintain a healthy dietary pattern which can yield health benefits in the short term and cumulatively over years this new edition of the dietary guidelines includes specific recommendations for all life stages now including infants and toddlers and pregnant and lactating women we are excited this is the first edition to provide guidance for every life stage this edition of the dietary guidelines is grounded in robust scientific reviews of the current body of evidence on key nutrition and health topics for each life stage we thank the 20 distinguished scientists on the 2020 dietary guidelines advisory committee for their expertise and dedication in conducting an independent scientific review that was characterized by more transparency and public participation throughout the process than ever before the committees work culminated in a comprehensive scientific report on the current state of nutrition science and provided advice to the departments for our development of this 9th edition of the dietary guidelines the committee also included important considerations for future research such as a need to reconsider the dietary reference intakes the us and canadian dietary reference intake steering committees are currently developing plans to reexamine energy protein fat and carbohydratethe timeline for these macronutrient reviews has not been established usda and hhs are looking forward to jointly funding the work to help guide our departments research agendas in the coming years with the science must come practicethat is making food and beverage choices that align with the dietary guidelines using the new edition of the dietary guidelines we hope americans can find ways to start simple and incorporate modest changes each day that push americans closer to meeting the recommendations its more important than ever to make healthy eating a priority in the united states with the release of the dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 we have an important call to action for you as health professionals and policymakers we are asking you to help the public make every bite count with the dietary guidelines for americans help people make food and beverage choices that are rich in nutritionindividual choices that can become a healthy routine over time choices they can enjoy in good health for many years to come thank you for all you do to help americans make strides toward aligning closer to the dietary guidelines as we all work together to help the public

and of those who provided public comments throughout the process page vii dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 executive summary executive summary the foods and beverages that people consume have a profound impact on their health the scientific connection between food and health has been well documented for many decades with substantial and increasingly robust evidence showing that a healthy lifestyleincluding following a healthy dietary pattern can help people achieve and maintain good health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases throughout all stages of the lifespan infancy and toddlerhood childhood and adolescence adulthood pregnancy and lactation and older adulthood the core elements of a healthy dietary pattern are remarkably consistent across the lifespan and across health outcomes since the first edition was published in 1980 the dietary guidelines for americans have provided sciencebased advice on what to eat and drink to promote health reduce risk of chronic disease and meet nutrient needs publication of the dietary guidelines is required under the 1990 national nutrition monitoring and related research act which states that at least every 5 years the us departments of agriculture usda and of health and human services hhs must jointly publish a report containing nutritional and dietary information and guidelines for the general public the statute public law 101445 7 united states code 5341 et seq requires that the dietary guidelines be based on the preponderance of current scientific and medical knowledge the 20202025 edition of the dietary guidelines builds from the 2015 edition with revisions grounded in the scientific report of the 2020 dietary guidelines advisory committee and consideration of federal agency and public comments the dietary guidelines is designed for policymakers and nutrition and health professionals to help all individuals and their families consume a healthy nutritionally adequate diet the information in the dietary guidelines is used to develop implement and evaluate federal food nutrition and health policies dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 executive summary page viii and programs it also is the basis for federal nutrition education materials designed for the public and for the nutrition education components of usda and hhs nutrition programs state and local governments schools the food industry other businesses community groups and media also use dietary guidelines information to develop programs policies and communication for the general public the aim of the dietary guidelines is to promote health and prevent disease because of this public health orientation the dietary guidelines is not intended to contain clinical guidelines for treating chronic diseases chronic diseases result from a complex mix of genetic biological behavioral socioeconomic and environmental factors and people with these conditions have unique health care requirements that require careful oversight by a health professional the body of scientific evidence on diet and health reviewed to inform the dietary guidelines is representative of the us populationit includes people who are healthy people at risk for dietrelated chronic conditions and diseases such as cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes and obesity and some people who are living with one or more of these dietrelated chronic illnesses at the same time it is essential that federal agencies medical organizations and health professionals adapt the dietary guidelines to meet the specific needs of their patients as part of an individual multifaceted treatment plan for the specific chronic disease consistent and evolving although many recommendations have remained relatively consistent over time the dietary guidelines also has built upon previous editions and evolved as scientific knowledge has grown the dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 reflects this in three important ways the first is its recognition that dietrelated chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes obesity and some types of cancer are very prevalent among americans and pose a major public health problem today more than half of adults have one or more dietrelated chronic diseases as a result recent editions of the dietary guidelines have focused on healthy individuals as well as those with overweight or obesity and those who are at risk of chronic disease a fundamental premise of the 2020 2025 dietary guidelines is that just about everyone no matter their health status can benefit from shifting food and beverage choices to better support healthy dietary patterns the second is its focus on dietary patterns researchers and public health experts including registered dietitians understand that nutrients and foods are not consumed in isolation rather people consume them in various combinations over timea dietary patternand these foods and beverages act synergistically to affect health the dietary guidelines for americans 20152020 puts this understanding into action by focusing its recommendations on consuming a healthy dietary pattern the 20202025 dietary guidelines carries forward this emphasis on the importance of a healthy dietary pattern as a whole rather than on individual nutrients foods or food groups in isolation the third is its focus on a lifespan approach this edition of the dietary guidelines highlights the importance of encouraging healthy dietary patterns at every life stage from infancy through older adulthood it provides recommendations for healthy dietary patterns by life stage identifying needs specific to each life stage and considering healthy dietary pattern characteristics that should be carried forward into the next stage of life for the first time since the 1985 edition the 2020 2025 dietary guidelines includes recommendations for healthy dietary patterns for infants and toddlers the guidelines the 20202025 dietary guidelines provides four overarching guidelines that encourage healthy eating patterns at each stage of life and recognize that individuals will need to make shifts in their food and beverage choices to achieve a healthy pattern the guidelines also explicitly emphasize that a healthy dietary pattern is not a rigid prescription rather the guidelines are a customizable framework of core elements within which individuals make tailored and affordable choices that meet their personal cultural and traditional preferences several examples of healthy dietary patterns that translate and integrate the recommendations in overall healthy ways to eat are provided the guidelines are supported by key recommendations that provide further guidance on healthy eating across the lifespan page ix dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 executive summary the guidelines make every bite count with the dietary guidelines for americans heres how 1 2 3 follow a healthy dietary pattern at every life stage at every life stageinfancy toddlerhood childhood adolescence adulthood pregnancy lactation and older adulthoodit is never too early or too late to eat healthfully for about the first 6 months of life exclusively feed infants human milk continue to feed infants human milk through at least the first year of life and longer if desired feed infants ironfortified infant formula during the first year of life when human milk is unavailable provide infants with supplemental vitamin d beginning soon after birth at about 6 months introduce infants to nutrientdense complementary foods introduce infants to potentially allergenic foods along with other complementary foods encourage infants and toddlers to consume a variety of foods from all food groups include foods rich in iron and zinc particularly for infants fed human milk from 12 months through older adulthood follow a healthy dietary pattern across the lifespan to meet nutrient needs help achieve a healthy body weight and reduce the risk of chronic disease customize and enjoy nutrientdense food and beverage choices to reflect personal preferences cultural traditions and budgetary considerations a healthy dietary pattern can benefit all individuals regardless of age race or ethnicity or current health status the dietary guidelines provides a framework intended to be customized to individual needs and preferences as well as the foodways of the diverse cultures in the united states focus on meeting food group needs with nutrientdense foods and beverages and stay within calorie limits an underlying premise of the dietary guidelines is that nutritional needs should be met primarily from foods and beveragesspecifically nutrientdense foods and beverages nutrientdense foods provide vitamins minerals and other healthpromoting components and have no or little added sugars saturated fat and sodium a healthy dietary pattern consists of nutrientdense forms of foods and beverages across all food groups in recommended amounts and within calorie limits the core elements that make up a healthy dietary pattern include vegetables of all typesdark green red and orange beans peas and lentils starchy and other vegetables fruits especially whole fruit grains at least half of which are whole grain dairy including fatfree or lowfat milk yogurt and cheese andor lactosefree versions and fortified soy beverages and yogurt as alternatives protein foods including lean meats poultry and eggs seafood beans peas and lentils and nuts seeds and soy products oils including vegetable oils and oils in food such as seafood and nuts dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 executive summary page x 4 limit foods and beverages higher in added sugars saturated fat and sodium and limit alcoholic beverages at every life stage meeting food group recommendationseven with nutrientdense choicesrequires most of a persons daily calorie needs and sodium limits a healthy dietary pattern doesnt have much room for extra added sugars saturated fat or sodiumor for alcoholic beverages a small amount of added sugars saturated fat or sodium can be added to nutrientdense foods and beverages to help meet food group recommendations but foods and beverages high in these components should be limited limits are added sugarsless than 10 percent of calories per day starting at age 2 avoid foods and beverages with added sugars for those younger than age 2 saturated fatless than 10 percent of calories per day starting at age 2 sodiumless than 2300 milligrams per dayand even less for children younger than age 14 alcoholic beveragesadults of legal drinking age can choose not to drink or to drink in moderation by limiting intake to 2 drinks or less in a day for men and 1 drink or less in a day for women when alcohol is consumed drinking less is better for health than drinking more there are some adults who should not drink alcohol such as women who are pregnant for most individuals no matter their age or health status achieving a healthy dietary pattern will require changes in food and beverage choices some of these changes can be accomplished by making simple substitutions while others will require greater effort to accomplish this edition of the dietary guidelines presents overall guidance on choosing nutrientdense foods and beverages in place of less healthy choices and also discusses special nutrition considerations for individuals at each life stageinfants and toddlers children and adolescents adults women who are pregnant or lactating and older adults although individuals ultimately decide what and how much to consume their personal relationships the settings in which they live learn work play and gather and other contextual factorsincluding their ability to consistently access healthy and affordable foodstrongly influence their choices health professionals communities businesses and industries organizations government and other segments of society all have a role to play in supporting individuals and families in making choices that align with the dietary guidelines and ensuring that all people have access to a healthy and affordable food supply resources including federal programs that support households regardless of size and makeup in choosing a healthy diet and improving access to healthy food are highlighted throughout this edition of the dietary guidelines for americans terms to know several terms are used throughout the dietary guidelines and are essential to understanding the guidelines and putting them into action these terms are defined here dietary pattern it is the combination of foods and beverages that constitutes an individuals complete dietary intake over time this may be a description of a customary way of eating or a description of a combination of foods recommended for consumption nutrient dense nutrientdense foods and beverages provide vitamins minerals and other healthpromoting components and have little added sugars saturated fat and sodium vegetables fruits whole grains seafood eggs beans peas and lentils unsalted nuts and seeds fatfree and lowfat dairy products and lean meats and poultrywhen prepared with no or little added sugars saturated fat and sodium are nutrientdense foods page 1 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 introduction dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 introduction page 2 introduction dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 introduction page 2 page 3 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 introduction setting the stage t he foods and beverages that people consume have a profound impact on their health the scientific connection between food and health has been well documented for many decades with substantial evidence showing that healthy dietary patterns can help people achieve and maintain good health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases throughout all stages of the lifespan yet federal data show that from the first edition of the dietary guidelines for americans in 1980 through today americans have fallen far short of meeting its recommendations and dietrelated chronic disease rates have risen to pervasive levels and continue to be a major public health concern the dietary guidelines is an important part of a complex multifaceted approach to promote health and reduce chronic disease risk the dietary guidelines provides sciencebased advice on what to eat and drink to promote health help reduce risk of chronic disease and meet nutrient needs the dietary guidelines is the foundation of federal food nutrition and health policies and programs an important audience is health professionals and nutrition program administrators who work with the general public to help them consume a healthy and nutritionally adequate diet and establish policies and services to support these efforts comprehensive coordinated strategies built on the sciencebased foundation of the dietary guidelinesand a commitment to drive these strategies over time across sectors and settingscan help all americans consume healthy dietary patterns achieve and maintain good health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases grounded in science and focused on public health the us departments of agriculture usda and of health and human services hhs update the dietary guidelines at least every 5 years based on the current science a fundamental premise of the dietary guidelines is that everyone no matter their age race or ethnicity economic circumstances or health status can benefit from shifting food and beverage choices to better support healthy dietary patterns dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 introduction page 4 to make sure that the dietary advice provided in the dietary guidelines is aimed at improving public health the science used to inform the guidelines has examined diet through a lens of health promotion and disease prevention and considered various segments of the united states population including ethnic populations who have disproportionately andor historically been affected by dietrelated disparities this means that priority has been placed on scientific studies that examine the relationship between diet and health across all life stages in men women and children from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds who are healthy or at risk of chronic disease over time eating patterns in the united states have remained far below dietary guidelines recommendations figure i1 concurrently it has become increasingly clear that dietrelated chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes obesity liver disease some types of cancer and dental caries pose a major public health problem for americans today 60 percent of adults have one or more dietrelated chronic diseases table i1 given its aim to prevent further disease incidence by promoting health and reducing chronic disease risk the dietary guidelines focuses on the general public including healthy individuals as well as those with overweight or obesity and those who are at risk of chronic disease the importance of following the dietary guidelines across all life stages has been brought into focus even more with the emergence of covid19 as people living with dietrelated chronic conditions and diseases are at an increased risk of severe illness from the novel coronavirus grounded in the current body of scientific evidence on diet and health that is relevant to all americans the dietary guidelines is a critically important tool for health professionals policymakers and many other professionals it is designed to help people make food and beverage choices all through life that are enjoyable and affordable and that also promote health and help prevent chronic disease figure i1 adherence of the us population to the dietary

spotlight on dietary patterns although many of its recommendations have remained relatively consistent over time the dietary guidelines has evolved as scientific knowledge has grown early dietary guidelines editions used evidence that examined the relationships between individual nutrients foods and food groups and health outcomes in recent years researchers public health experts and registered dietitians have acknowledged that nutrients and foods are not consumed in isolation rather people consume them in various combinations over timea dietary patternand these foods and beverages act synergistically to affect health the 20152020 dietary guidelines put this understanding into action by focusing its recommendations on consuming a healthy dietary pattern the 20202025 dietary guidelines carries forward this emphasis on the importance of a healthy dietary pattern as a whole rather than on individual nutrients or foods in isolation serving as a framework the guidelines dietary patterns approach enables policymakers programs and health professionals to help people personalize their food and beverage choices to accommodate their wants and needs food preferences cultural traditions and customs and budgetary considerations healthy dietary patterns at every life stage the 20202025 dietary guidelines takes the dietary patterns approach one step further by focusing on the importance of encouraging healthy dietary patterns at every stage of life from birth to older adulthood it provides recommendations for healthy dietary patterns by life stage identifying needs specific to each life stage and considering healthy dietary pattern characteristics that should be carried forward into the next stage of life and for the first time since the 1985 edition this edition of the dietary guidelines includes recommendations for infants and toddlers as well as continuing the emphasis on healthy dietary patterns during pregnancy and lactation this approach recognizes that each life stage is distinctnutrient needs vary over the lifespan and each life stage has unique implications for food and beverage choices and disease risk at the same time it recognizes an important continuity because early food preferences influence later food choices establishing a healthy dietary pattern early in life may have a beneficial impact on health promotion and disease prevention over the course of decades page 7 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 introduction dietary guidelines for americans what it is what it is not the dietary guidelines translates the current science on diet and health into guidance to help people choose foods and beverages that comprise a healthy and enjoyable dietary patternthe what and how much of foods and beverages to consume to achieve good health reduce risk of dietrelated chronic diseases and meet nutrient needs the dietary guidelines is just one piece of the nutrition guidance landscape however other guidance is designed to address requirements for the specific nutrients contained in foods and beverages or to address treatments for individuals who have a chronic disease the following section describes the role of the dietary guidelines within this larger nutrition guidance landscape quantitative guidance on foods not nutrient requirements nutrient requirements are established and updated by the national academies of sciences engineering and medicine at the request of the us and canadian federal governments the academies set the quantitative requirements or limitsknown as dietary reference intakes drion nutrients which include macronutrients ie protein carbohydrates and fats vitamins and minerals eg vitamin c iron and sodium and food components eg dietary fiber because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods thus the dietary guidelines translates the academies nutrient requirements into food and beverage recommendations the dietary guidelines recognizes though that in some cases fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients eg during specific life stages such as pregnancy health promotion not disease treatment at its core the dietary guidelines has a public health missionthat is health promotion and disease prevention medical and nutrition professionals may use or adapt the dietary guidelines to encourage their patients or clients to follow a healthy dietary pattern the body of current scientific evidence on diet and health reviewed to inform the dietary guidelines included study participants who represent the us population including healthy individuals and people at risk of dietrelated chronic conditions and diseases such as cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes or obesity and some people who are living with a diet related chronic illness because of this public health orientation the dietary guidelines is not intended to be a clinical guideline for treating chronic diseases however the dietary guidelines often has served as a reference for federal medical voluntary and patient care organizations as they develop clinical nutrition guidance tailored for people living with a specific medical condition chronic diseases result from a complex mix of genetic biological behavioral socioeconomic and environmental factors and people with these conditions have unique health care requirements that require careful oversight by a health professional health professionals can adapt the dietary guidelines to meet the specific needs of their patients with chronic diseases as part of a multifaceted treatment plan developing the dietary guidelines for americans the process to develop the dietary guidelines has evolved over time in step with developments in nutrition science public health and best practices in scientific review and guidance development usda and hhs work together to determine the approach for each edition as stipulated by law usda and hhs must update the dietary guidelines at least every 5 years the guidelines must be grounded in the body of scientific and medical knowledge available at that time not in individual studies or individual expert opinion in establishing the process for the 20202025 dietary guidelines usda and hhs considered and integrated recommendations from a comprehensive 2017 national academies study review of the process to update the dietary guidelines greater transparency figured prominently in the academies recommendations as a result in developing the 20202025 process usda and hhs made significant changes to increase transparency and public participation while maintaining the core element of scientific integrity one of these changes was the addition of a new stage at the beginning of the process thus the 20202025 process consisted of four stages 1 identify the topics dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 introduction page 8 stage 1 identify topics and supporting scientific questions stage 2 appoint a dietary guidelines advisory committee to review evidence stage 3 develop the dietary guidelines stage 4 implement the dietary guidelines and supporting scientific questions to be examined 2 appoint a dietary guidelines advisory committee to review current scientific evidence 3 develop the new edition of the dietary guidelines and 4 implement the dietary guidelines through federal programs the following information provides an overview of the 4stage process more details are available at dietaryguidelinesgov stage 1 identify topics and supporting scientific questions the departments added a new step of identifying topics and scientific questions to begin the process of developing the next dietary guidelines this was done to promote a deliberate and transparent process better define the expertise needed on the committee and ensure the scientific review conducted by the committee would address federal nutrition policy and program needs and help manage resources in consultation with agencies across the federal government usda and hhs identified potential topics and supporting scientific questions that were of greatest importance and relevance to federal nutrition programs policies and consumer education priorities compared to all previous dietary guidelines processes the topic areas for 20202025 expanded due to the added focus on infants and toddlers from birth through age 23 months as well as women who are pregnant the agricultural act of 2014 mandated that beginning with the 20202025 edition the dietary guidelines should expand to include dietary guidance for these populations thus the topics and questionsand areas of expertise needed on the committeereflected this change the departments posted the topics and questions publicly on dietaryguidelinesgov allowing the public and federal agencies 30 days to view and provide comments following review of the comments usda and hhs posted the final topics and questions along with the public call for nominations to the 2020 committee having topics and questions identified upfront helped inform the publics nominations by defining which areas of nutrition expertise were needed on the committee stage 2 appoint a dietary guidelines advisory committee to review current scientific evidence in the second stage the secretaries of usda and hhs appointed the committee with the single timelimited task of reviewing the 20152020 dietary guidelines examining the evidence on the selected nutrition and public health topics and scientific questions and providing independent sciencebased advice and recommendations to usda and hhs the 20 nationally recognized scientific experts appointed to the committee represented a mix of practitioners epidemiologists scientists clinical trialists and others from every region of the united states the use of a federal advisory committee is a commonly used best practice to ensure the federal government seeks sound external scientific advice to inform decisions the committees work concluded with its scientific report submitted to the secretaries of usda and hhs in june 20201 this report was not a draft of the dietary guidelines it was a scientific document that detailed the committees evidence review and provided advice to usda and hhs the committee was divided into six subcommittees to conduct its work dietary patterns pregnancy and lactation birth to age 24 months beverages and added sugars dietary fats and seafood and frequency 1 dietary guidelines advisory committee 2020 scientific report of the 2020 dietary guidelines advisory committee advisory report to the secretary of agriculture and the secretary of health and human services us department of agriculture agricultural research service washington dc page 9 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 introduction of eating the committee also formed one crosscutting working groupdata analysis and food pattern modeling to support work across the subcommittees the committees work had three defining characteristics the use of three approaches to examine the evidence the creation of transparent protocols before the evidence review began and the development of scientific review conclusion statements for the scientific reviews conducted three approaches to examine the evidence the 2020 committee used three stateoftheart approaches to conduct its robust and rigorous reviews data analysis using federal nationally representative data this approach provided insights into current eating habits of the us population and current dietrelated chronic disease rates in the united states these data helped make the dietary guidelines practical relevant and achievable the committee used data analysis to address scientific questions that looked at current dietary patterns and beverage consumption current intakes of food groups and nutrients dietary components of public health concern prevalence of nutritionrelated chronic health conditions and relationships between eating habits and achieving nutrient and food group recommendations nutrition evidence systematic review nesr systematic reviews are research projects that follow meticulously defined protocols ie plans to answer clearly formulated scientific questions by searching for evaluating and synthesizing all relevant peerreviewed studies systematic reviews are considered a gold standard method to inform development of evidencebased guidelines by ensuring consideration of the strongest most appropriate body of evidence available on a topic usdas nutrition evidence systematic review is a team of scientists who specializes in conducting systematic reviews focused on nutrition and disease prevention and evaluating scientific evidence on nutrition topics relevant to federal policy and programs nesr used its rigorous protocoldriven methodology to support the committee in conducting its systematic reviews new to the 2020 process usda and hhs added a step for peer review of the systematic reviews by federal scientists food pattern modeling this type of analysis illustrates how changes to the amounts or types of foods and beverages in a dietary pattern might affect meeting nutrient needs across the us population the committee used this method to assess potential changes to the usda dietary patterns which help meet the dris set by the national academies while taking into consideration current consumption in the united states and the conclusions from its systematic reviews as with all food pattern modeling for the dietary guidelines the results of the committees food pattern modeling tests were interpreted in light of two key assumptions first the modeling tests were based on nutrient profiles of nutrientdense foods in the us food supply and us populationbased dietary data populationbased patterns articulate the evidence on the relationships between diet and health in ways that might be adopted by the us public as a whole second modeling tests assumed populationwide compliance with all food intake recommendations as with other types of modeling the food pattern modeling is hypothetical and does not predict the behaviors of individuals each of these approaches had its own rigorous protocoldriven methodology and each had a unique complementary role in examining the science additional detailed information is available at dietaryguidelinesgov and nesrusdagov dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 introduction page 10 transparent protocols first then review to answer each scientific question the committee first created a protocol that described how the committee would apply one of the three approaches to examine the evidence related to that specific question the committee created each protocol before examining any evidence and for the first time the protocols were posted online for the public as they were being developed this enabled the public to understand how a specific scientific question would be answered and to have the opportunity to submit public comments before the committee completed the protocols and conducted its reviews of the scientific evidence detailed information on the committees review is documented in its scientific report which is available on dietaryguidelinesgov health status of participants in studies included in nutrition evidence systematic reviews to ensure that the dietary guidelines promotes the health of and reduce risk of disease among all americans the evidence base that informs the dietary guidelines must comprise studies conducted with people who are representative of the general public and must examine diet through a health promotion and disease prevention lens as outlined in the committees systematic review protocols the committees reviews included studies with participants who were healthy and or who were at risk of a chronic disease including participants with obesity as well as studies that enrolled some participants with a disease because the dietary guidelines is not intended to be a clinical guideline for treating chronic diseases the committee excluded studies that enrolled only patients with a disease with the intention to treat those individuals in general the majority of the reviews conducted to inform the dietary guidelines included trials that exclusively enrolled participants with overweight or obesity or who were at high risk of cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes and observational studies that enrolled participants from a wide range of health and weight status including those with healthy weight overweight or obesity the reviews included few studies that enrolled only healthy participants thus the dietary guidelines are applicable to the overall us population including healthy individuals and people at risk of dietrelated chronic conditions and diseases such as cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes and obesity in addition people living with a diet related chronic illness can benefit from a healthy dietary pattern the dietary guidelines can serve as a reference for federal medical voluntary and patient care organizations as they develop nutrition guidance tailored for people living with a specific medical condition health professionals can adapt the dietary guidelines to meet the specific needs of their patients with chronic diseases as part of a multifaceted treatment plan page 11 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 introduction conclusion statements for the scientific reviews conducted for all topics and questions regardless of the approach used to identify and evaluate the scientific evidence the committee developed conclusion statements each conclusion statement provided a succinct answer to the specific question posed the committee took the strengths and limitations of the evidence base into consideration when formulating conclusion statements for questions answered using nesr systematic reviews the conclusion statements included a grade to indicate the strength of the evidence supporting the conclusion statement the grades were strong moderate limited or grade not assignable grading the strength of the evidence applied only to questions answered using nesr systematic reviews it did not apply to questions answered using data analysis or food pattern modeling therefore data analysis and food pattern modeling conclusion statements were not graded as it completed its work the committee looked across all of the conclusion statements to develop overarching advice for usda and hhs to consider as the departments developed the next edition of the dietary guidelines using these three approaches the committee worked collaboratively for 16 months and deliberated on the scientific reviews in six meetings all of which were open to the public two of the six meetings included an opportunity for the public to provide oral comments to the committee an ongoing period for written public comments to the committee spanned 15 months of its work and for the first time a final public meeting was included for the committee to discuss its draft scientific report 1 month before the final report was posted for public comment in addition to documenting its rigorous review of the evidence to answer the scientific questions from usda and hhs and providing advice for the departments development of the next dietary guidelines edition the committee provided recommendations for future research these research recommendations reflected an acknowledgment that science in nutrition diet and health associations continues to evolve and that new findings build on and enhance existing evidence upon submitting its final scientific report to the usda and hhs secretaries the committee disbanded the departments then posted the scientific report and asked the public for comments the departments received written comments on the report over a 30day period and also held an online meeting to hear oral comments stage 3 develop the dietary guidelines each edition of the dietary guidelines builds on the preceding edition with the scientific justification for revisions informed by the committees scientific report and consideration of public and federal agency comments as with previous editions development of the 20202025 dietary guidelines involved a stepby step process of writing review and revision conducted by a writing team of federal staff from usda and hhs dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 introduction page 12 the writing team included federal nutrition scientists with expertise in the dietary guidelines and related research and programs as well as specialists with expertise in communicating nutrition information key tenets of writing the dietary guidelines are that it must represent the totality of the evidence examined address the needs of federal programs reduce unintended consequences follow best practices for developing guidelines use plain language the draft dietary guidelines went through internal and external review ultimately the document was reviewed by all agencies with nutrition policies and programs across usda and hhs such as usdas food and nutrition service and its food safety and inspection service and hhs national institutes of health food and drug administration and centers for disease control and prevention the draft dietary guidelines also went through an external expert peer review to ensure that it accurately reflected the body of evidence documented in the committees scientific report this process culminated with approval by the secretaries of usda and hhs after approval by the secretaries the departments released the dietary guidelines to federal agencies and the public for implementation across programs and through educational activities stage 4 implement the dietary guidelines the us government uses the dietary guidelines as the basis of its food assistance and meal programs nutrition education efforts and decisions about national health objectives for example the national school lunch program and the older americans act nutrition program incorporate the dietary guidelines in menu planning the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children applies the dietary guidelines in its program and educational materials and the healthy people objectives for the nation include objectives based on the dietary guidelines the dietary guidelines also provides a critical structure for state and local public health promotion and disease prevention initiatives in addition it provides foundational evidencebased nutrition guidance for use by individuals and those who serve them in public and private settings including health professionals public health and social service agencies health care and educational institutions researchers agricultural producers food and beverage manufacturers and more page 13 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 introduction using myplate as a guide to support healthy dietary patterns implementation of the dietary guidelines through myplate the dietary guidelines for americans is developed and written for a professional audience therefore its translation into actionable consumer messages and resources is crucial to help individuals families and communities achieve healthy dietary patterns myplate is one example of consumer translation created to be used in various settings and adaptable to meeting personal preferences cultural foodways traditions and budget needs myplate is used by professionals across sectors to help people become more aware of and informed about making healthy food and beverage choices over time more information is available at myplategov following a healthy dietary pattern from birth through older adulthood can have a profound impact on a persons lifelong health the dietary guidelines provides the framework for following such a pattern however broad and multisector collaboration is needed to help people achieve that goal action on many fronts is needed to ensure that healthy dietary choices at home school work and play are the affordable accessible norm everyone has a role to play in helping all americans shift to a healthy dietary pattern and achieve better health try the myplate plan a healthy eating routine is important at every stage of life and can have positive effects that add up over time its important to eat a variety of fruits vegetables grains dairy or fortified soy alternatives and protein foods

20202025 reflecting the accumulating body of evidence about the relationships between diet and health outcomes the 20202025 dietary guidelines presents its recommendations with a primary emphasis on encouraging the consumption of a healthy overall dietary pattern at every stage of life from birth through older adulthood this edition of the dietary guidelines consists of an executive summary this introduction six chapters and three appendixes chapter 1 nutrition and health across the lifespan the guidelines and key recommendations discusses the health benefits of lifelong healthy dietary choices and explains the four guidelines and supporting key recommendations this chapter is the basis for all the succeeding chapters chapters 2 through 6 should be read in tandem with chapter 1 chapter 2 infants and toddlers is the first of five chapters that focus on healthy dietary patterns for a specific life stage this edition of the dietary guidelines is the first since the 1985 edition to provide guidance for infants and toddlers birth through age 23 months the chapter provides specific key recommendations for this age group along with guidance on how to put these recommendations into action the chapter closes with a healthy dietary pattern during the second year of life and a look toward the next life stage children and adolescents chapter 3 children and adolescents first sets the stage by describing nutrition issues specific to children and adolescents ages 2 through 18 it then presents the recommended healthy dietary patterns for this age group explains how current intakes compare to recommendations and discusses special dietary guidance considerations for this life stage the chapter concludes with a discussion of ways to support healthy dietary patterns among children and adolescents and a look toward the next life stageadults chapter 4 adults opens with a discussion of selected nutrition issues that characterize the adult life stage ages 19 through 59 it then presents the recommended healthy dietary patterns for this age group explains how current intakes compare to recommendations and discusses special dietary guidance considerations for adults the chapter concludes with suggestions for how to support healthy dietary patterns among adults and a look toward two important adult life stageswomen who are pregnant or lactating and older adults

first year of life and longer if desired feed infants ironfortified infant formula during the first year of life when human milk is unavailable provide infants with supplemental vitamin d beginning soon after birth at about 6 months introduce infants to nutrientdense complementary foods introduce infants to potentially allergenic foods along with other complementary foods encourage infants and toddlers to consume a variety of foods from all food groups include foods rich in iron and zinc particularly for infants fed human milk from 12 months through older adulthood follow a healthy dietary pattern across the lifespan to meet nutrient needs help achieve a healthy body weight and reduce the risk of chronic disease customize and enjoy nutrient dense food and beverage choices to reflect personal preferences cultural traditions and budgetary considerations a healthy dietary pattern can benefit all individuals regardless of age race or ethnicity or current health status the dietary guidelines provides a framework intended to be customized to individual needs and preferences as well as the foodways of the diverse cultures in the united states focus on meeting food group needs with nutrientdense foods and beverages and stay within calorie limits an underlying premise of the dietary guidelines is that nutritional needs should be met primarily from foods and beveragesspecifically nutrientdense foods and beverages nutrientdense foods provide vitamins minerals and other healthpromoting components and have no or little added sugars saturated fat and sodium a healthy dietary pattern consists of nutrientdense forms of foods and beverages across all food groups in recommended amounts and within calorie limits the core elements that make up a healthy dietary pattern include vegetables of all typesdark green red and orange beans peas and lentils starchy and other vegetables fruits especially whole fruit grains at least half of which are whole grain dairy including fatfree or lowfat milk yogurt and cheese andor lactosefree versions and fortified soy beverages and yogurt as alternatives protein foods including lean meats poultry and eggs seafood beans peas and lentils and nuts seeds and soy products oils including vegetable oils and oils in food such as seafood and nuts limit foods and beverages higher in added sugars saturated fat and sodium and limit alcoholic beverages at every life stage meeting food group recommendationseven with nutrient dense choicesrequires most of a persons daily calorie needs and sodium limits a healthy dietary pattern doesnt have much room for extra added sugars saturated fat or sodiumor for alcoholic beverages a small amount of added sugars saturated fat or sodium can be added to nutrientdense foods and beverages to help meet food group recommendations but foods and beverages high in these components should be limited limits are added sugarsless than 10 percent of calories per day starting at age 2 avoid foods and beverages with added sugars for those younger than age 2 saturated fatless than 10 percent of calories per day starting at age 2 sodiumless than 2300 milligrams per dayand even less for children younger than age 14 alcoholic beveragesadults of legal drinking age can choose not to drink or to drink in moderation by limiting intake to 2 drinks or less in a day for men and 1 drink or less in a day for women when alcohol is consumed drinking less is better for health than drinking more there are some adults who should not drink alcohol such as women who are pregnant 3 guideline guideline 2 4 guideline page 19 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 1 nutrition and health across the lifespan 1 if not specified explicitly references to foods refer to foods and beverages a fundamental premise of the dietary guidelines is that almost everyone no matter an individuals age race or ethnicity or health status can benefit from shifting food and beverage choices to better support healthy dietary patterns healthy eating starts at birth with the exclusive consumption of human milk if possible for about the first 6 months if human milk is unavailable infants should be fed an ironfortified commercial infant formula ie labeled with iron regulated by the us food and drug administration fda which are based on standards that ensure nutrient content and safety healthy eating continues with the introduction of complementary foods and beverages at about 6 months of age by 12 months infants should maintain their healthy eating as they transition to developmentally appropriate foods and beverages healthy eating continues in each life stage thereafter even though nutrient needs vary across life stages the foods and beverages that individuals should eat over the lifespan are remarkably consistent this chapter provides foundational guidance about maintaining a healthy dietary pattern across each life stageinfancy toddlerhood childhood adolescence adulthood pregnancy lactation and older adulthood because the nutritional needs and transition of infants and toddlers are unique chapter 2 provides a focused discussion on this age group chapters 3 4 5 and 6 then provide tailored nutrition information specific to children and adolescents adults women who are pregnant or lactating and older adults respectively what is a dietary pattern over the course of any given day week or year individuals consume foods and beverages1 in combinationa dietary pattern a dietary pattern represents the totality of what individuals habitually eat and drink and the parts of the pattern act synergistically to affect health as a result the dietary pattern may better predict overall health status and disease risk than individual foods or nutrients a healthy dietary pattern consists of nutrientdense forms of foods and beverages across all food groups in recommended amounts and within calorie limits achieving a healthy dietary pattern at each life stage not only supports health at that point in time but also supports health in the next life stage and possibly for future generations if healthy dietary patterns can be established early in life and sustained thereafter the impact on health could be significant establishing and maintaining a healthy dietary pattern can help minimize dietrelated chronic disease risk conversely consuming foods and beverages that are not nutrient dense may lead to disease expression in later years high intakes of such foods ie an unhealthy dietary pattern throughout the lifespan can increase the risk of developing chronic diseases the good news is that at any stage of life individuals can make efforts to adopt a healthy dietary pattern and improve their health the healthy usstyle dietary pattern usdas primary dietary pattern provides a framework for healthy eating that all americans can follow it is based on the types and proportions of foods americans of all ages genders races and ethnicities typically consume but in nutrientdense forms and appropriate amounts the healthy usstyle dietary pattern is carried forward from the 20152020 dietary guidelines for americans the 2000calorie level of the pattern is shown in table 11 the healthy mediterraneanstyle dietary pattern and the healthy vegetarian dietary pattern also carried forward from the 20152020 dietary guidelines for americansare variations of the healthy usstyle dietary pattern that have the same core elements the usda dietary patterns are described in appendix 3 usda dietary patterns and are meant to be tailored to meet cultural and personal preferences and used as guides to plan and serve meals for individuals households and in a variety of institutions and other settings the dietary approaches to stop hypertension dash dietary pattern

dietary pattern science is the foundation of the dietary guidelines recommendations on what americans should eat and drink to promote health reduce risk of chronic disease and meet nutrient needs the science shows that consuming a healthy dietary pattern meeting food group and nutrient needs with nutrientdense foods and beverages and limiting intake of foods and beverages that are not nutrientdense is related to many health benefits science also supports the idea that every life stage provides an opportunity to make food choices that promote health and wellbeing achieve and maintain appropriate weight status and reduce risk of dietrelated chronic disease the science supporting the dietary guidelines is extensively documented in the scientific report of the 2020 dietary guidelines advisory committee which describes the state of the science on key topics related to diet and health outcomes with strong or moderate evidence are provided in figure 13 the report is available at dietaryguidelinesgov evidence on the association between dietary patterns and reduced risk of dietrelated chronic diseases has expanded in recent years and supports the use of dietary patterns as a foundation for the recommendations in the dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 consistent evidence demonstrates that a healthy dietary pattern is associated with beneficial outcomes for allcause mortality cardiovascular disease overweight and obesity type 2 diabetes bone health and certain types of cancer breast and colorectal common characteristics of dietary patterns associated with positive health outcomes include relatively higher intake of vegetables fruits legumes whole grains low or nonfat dairy lean meats and poultry seafood nuts and unsaturated vegetable oils and relatively lower consumption of red and processed meats sugarsweetened foods and beverages and refined grains the evidence examined showed broad representation across a number of populations and demographic groups this suggests a consistent association no matter the region or cultural context in which a healthy dietary pattern is consumed in addition dietary patterns characterized by higher intake of red and processed meats sugarsweetened foods and beverages and refined grains are in and of themselves associated with detrimental health outcomes these findings are consistent withand build onthe evidence base that informed the 2015 2020 dietary guidelines a healthy dietary pattern supports appropriate calorie levels the total number of calories a person needs each day varies depending on a number of factors namely the persons age sex height weight level of physical activity and pregnancy or lactation status due to reductions in basal metabolic rate that occur with aging calorie needs generally decrease for adults as they age in addition a need to lose maintain or gain weight affects how many calories should be consumed estimated amounts of calories needed based on age sex and level of physical activity are provided in appendix 2 estimated calorie needs and estimated calorie needs relevant for different ages are provided in each life stage chapter these estimates are based on the estimated energy requirement eer equations established by the national academies of sciences engineering and medicine national academies using reference heights average and reference weights healthy for each agesex group these amounts are estimates the best way to evaluate calorie intake in comparison to calorie needs is by measuring body weight status rather than focus on weight status at any one point in life the dietary guidelines supports healthy weight trajectories at each stage of lifeappropriate weight gain during pregnancy and postpartum weight loss healthy growth and development from infancy through adolescence weight stability during midlife and healthy body composition late in life meeting the dietary guidelines recommendations within calorie needs can help prevent excess weight gain at every life stage and support overall good health 1 guideline dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 1 nutrition and health across the lifespan page 24 1

assignable only outcomes with strong or moderate evidence are included in this table see the committees report for specific graded conclusion statements page 25 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 1 nutrition and health across the lifespan key dietary principles to help people meet the guidelines and key recommendations the following are important principles when making decisions about nutrient dense food and beverage choices to achieve a healthy dietary pattern meet nutritional needs primarily from foods and beverages the dietary guidelines are designed to meet the recommended dietary allowances and adequate intakes for essential nutrients as well as acceptable macronutrient distribution ranges all set by the national academies an underlying premise of the dietary guidelines is that nutritional needs should be met primarily from foods and beverages specifically nutrientdense foods and beverages in some cases when meeting nutrient needs is not otherwise possible fortified foods and nutrientcontaining dietary supplements are useful it is important to note that the nutrient density and healthfulness of what people eat and drink often is determined ultimately by how a food item dish or meal is prepared at home and away from home or produced by a manufacturer based on the us food supply and marketplace the examples of healthy dietary patterns in this edition are achievable through thoughtful informed choices one decision one meal one day at a timeand consistently over time choose a variety of options from each food group enjoy different foods and beverages within each food group this can help meet nutrient needsand also allows for flexibility so that the dietary guidelines can be tailored to meet cultural and personal preferences all forms of foods including fresh canned dried frozen and 100 juices in nutrientdense forms can be included in healthy dietary patterns pay attention to portion size portion size is a term often used to describe the amount of a food or beverage served or consumed in one eating occasion it is important to pay attention to portion size when making food and beverage choices particularly for foods and beverages that are not nutrientdense a concept that can help people choose appropriate portions is serving size this term is included on the nutrition facts label and refers to the amount of a food or beverage that is customarily consumedit is not a recommendation of how much to eat or drink consuming less than the stated serving size results in consuming fewer calories and other nutrients or food

follow a healthy dietary pattern the typical dietary patterns currently consumed by many in the united states do not align with the dietary guidelines figure 14 the healthy eating index hei is a measure of diet quality that can be used to assess compliance with the dietary guidelines for americans ages 2 and older hei2015 scores indicate that intakes are not consistent with recommendations for a healthy dietary pattern average diet quality has slightly improved in the past 10 years but the average score of 59 on a scale from 0 to 100 indicates that people have much room for improvement differences in overall hei scores are seen across age sex raceethnic and income subgroups and by pregnancy and lactation status though poor diet quality is observed across all groups with each step closer to a diet that aligns with the core elements of a healthy dietary pattern hei scores will increase and risk for chronic disease will decrease figure 14 adherence of the us population to the

with overweight or obesity suggests that many people in the united states consume foods and beverages that contribute to a calorie imbalance a situation more likely to occur with low physical activity as shown in the introduction table i1 74 percent of all adults and 40 percent of all children and youth in the united states have either overweight or obesity even from the youngest ages almost all americans should shift to healthier food and beverage choices and consume smaller portions to achieve a healthy dietary pattern within an appropriate number of calories it is never too early or too late to improve intake and establish a healthy dietary pattern page 27 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 1 nutrition and health across the lifespan guideline 2 customize and enjoy food and beverage choices to reflect personal preferences cultural traditions and budgetary considerations eating should be enjoyed and a healthy dietary pattern can be enjoyable from early life to older adulthood the science reviewed to inform the dietary guidelines represents the diversity of americans including all ages and life stages different racial and ethnic backgrounds and a range of socioeconomic statuses a healthy dietary pattern can benefit all individuals regardless of age race or ethnicity or current health status the dietary guidelines provides a framework intended to be customized to fit individual household and federal program participants preferences as well as the foodways of the diverse cultures in the united states the us population is diverse in myriad ways the dietary guidelines framework purposely provides recommendations by food groups and subgroupsnot specific foods and beveragesto avoid being prescriptive this framework approach ensures that people can make it their own by selecting healthy foods beverages meals and snacks specific to their needs and preferences the food groups include a broad variety of nutrientdense food and beverage choices in every setting across all cultures and at any age or budget there are foods and beverages that can fit within the dietary guidelines framework start with personal preferences exposure to different types of food is important early in life to better develop a childs interest and willingness to eat and enjoy a variety of foods through each life stage that follows a key starting point for establishing and maintaining a healthy dietary pattern is to ensure that individual andor family preferencesin nutrientdense formsare built into daytoday choices incorporate cultural traditions cultural background can have significant influence on food and beverage choices customizing the dietary guidelines framework to reflect specific cultures and traditions is an important strategy to help communities across the country eat and enjoy a healthy dietary pattern nutrientdense culturally relevant foods and beverages are part of all of the food groups spices and herbs can help flavor foods when reducing added sugars saturated fat and sodium and they also can add to the enjoyment of nutrientdense foods dishes and meals that reflect specific cultures relying on the expertise of professionals in nutrition and in specific cultural foodways can help people prepare foods healthfully while retaining heritage consider budget despite a common perception that eating healthfully is expensive a healthy dietary pattern can be affordable and fit within budgetary constraints there are a range of strategies that can be used to help individuals and families follow a healthy dietary pattern including advanced planning considering regional and seasonal food availability and incorporating a variety of fresh frozen dried and canned options the usda food plansthrifty lowcost moderatecost and liberalcost food planseach represent a nutritious diet at a different cost level these plans are scheduled to be revised with an updated thrifty food plan published by the end of 2022

needs with nutrientdense foods and beverages and stay within calorie limits the dietary guidelines include recommendations for food groupsvegetables fruits grains dairy and protein foods eaten at an appropriate calorie level and in forms with limited amounts of added sugars saturated fat and sodium science shows that these same core elements of a healthy dietary pattern are consistent across each life stage however as shown in figure 16 when compared to the healthy usstyle dietary pattern most americans have substantial room for improvement more than 80 percent have dietary patterns that are low in vegetables fruits and dairy more than half of the population is meeting or exceeding total grain and total protein foods recommendations but are not meeting the recommendations for the subgroups within each of these food groups figure 16 dietary intakes compared to recommendations percent of the us population ages 1 and older who are below and at or above each dietary goal note recommended daily intake of whole grains is to be at least half of total grain consumption and the limit for refined grains is to be no more than half of total grain consumption data source analysis

patterns eating an appropriate mix of foods from the food groups and subgroupswithin an appropriate calorie levelis important to promote health at each life stage each of the food groups and their subgroups provides an array of nutrients and the amounts recommended reflect eating patterns that have been associated with positive health outcomes foods from all of the food groups should be eaten in nutrientdense forms the following sections describe special considerations related to each food group vegetables healthy dietary patterns include a variety of vegetables from all five vegetable subgroupsdark green red and orange beans peas and lentils starchy and other these include all fresh frozen canned and dried options in cooked or raw forms including 100 vegetable juices vegetables in their nutrientdense forms have limited additions such as salt butter or creamy sauces examples of vegetables in each of the subgroups are available in appendix 3 almost 90 percent of the us population does not meet the recommendation for vegetables in addition with few exceptions the us population does not meet intake recommendations for any of the vegetable subgroups about 45 percent of all vegetables are eaten as a separate food item about 40 percent as part of a mixed dish and the remainder are mostly consumed as snack foods and condiments vegetables when consumed on their own are generally consumed in forms with additional sodium either from salt added in cooking or added sauces such as soy sauce or bottled stirfry sauces many vegetables are consumed as part of mixed dishes like sandwiches pasta with a tomatobased sauce or casseroles that may have other ingredients that are sources of saturated fat andor sodium for most individuals following a healthy eating pattern will require an increase in total vegetable intake and from all vegetable subgroups shifting to nutrientdense forms and an increase in the variety of different vegetables consumed over time vegetables can be part of many types of mixed dishes from burgers sandwiches and tacos to pizza stews pasta dishes grainbased casseroles and soups strategies to increase vegetable intake include increasing the vegetable content of mixed dishes or eating less of a main dish to allow for more vegetables as side disheskeeping these nutrient dense 3 guideline learn more table a32 in appendix 3 provides the food groupbased healthy usstyle dietary pattern as a sample framework information on what counts as a cup or ounceequivalent is also provided under this table in footnote c about beans peas and lentils beans peas and lentils is a new name for the vegetable subgroup formerly called legumes beans and peas beans peas and lentils which also are known as pulses include the dried edible seeds of legumes the foods in this vegetable subgroup have not changed however the new name of the subgroup more accurately reflects the category of foods included beans include varieties such as kidney beans pinto beans white beans black beans lima beans and fava beans also included are dried peas eg chickpeas blackeyed peas pigeon peas and split peas and lentils edamame which is the soybean in the pod is counted in the beans peas and lentils subgroup even though it is eaten fresh and not dried because beans peas and lentils have a similar nutrient profile to foods in both the vegetable group and the protein foods group they may be thought of as either a vegetable or a protein food when aiming to meet recommended intakes green peas and green string beans are not counted in the beans peas and lentils subgroup because the nutrient content of these vegetables is more similar to vegetables in other subgroups green peas which are not dried before consumption are grouped with starchy vegetables and green beans are in the other vegetables subgroup which includes onions iceberg lettuce celery and cabbage generally foods made from processed soybeans are a part of the nuts seeds and soy products protein foods subgroup dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 1 nutrition and health across the lifespan page 32 fruits the fruit food group includes whole fruits and 100 fruit juice whole fruits include fresh canned frozen and dried forms whole fruits can be eaten in various forms such as cut sliced diced or cubed at least half of the recommended amount of fruit should come from whole fruit rather than 100 juice when juices are consumed they should be 100 juice and always pasteurized or 100 juice diluted with water without added sugars also when selecting canned fruit choose options that are canned with 100 juice or options lowest in added sugars about 80 percent of the us population does not meet fruit recommendations over 60 percent of all fruit intake comes from whole formsfresh canned frozen or driedor 100 juice fruit is generally consumed in nutrientdense forms such as plain bananas apples oranges or grapes however some fruit is consumed as part of foods that may not be nutrientdense such as fruit pie or similar desserts most people would benefit from increasing their intake of fruit mostly as whole fruits in nutrientdense forms a wide variety of fruits are available in the us marketplace some yearround and others seasonally strategies to help achieve this shift include choosing more whole fruits as snacks and including them in meals grains healthy dietary patterns include whole grains and limit the intake of refined grains at least half of total grains should be whole grains individuals who eat refined grains should choose enriched grains individuals who consume all of their grains as whole grains should include some that have been fortified with folic acid grainbased foods in nutrientdense forms limit the additions of added sugars saturated fat and sodium a food is a 100 wholegrain food if the only grains it contains are whole grains a 1 ounceequivalent of 100 whole grains has 16 grams of whole grains the recommendation to consume at least half of total grains as whole grains can be met in a number of ways choose 100 wholegrain foods for at least half of all grains consumed the relative amount of whole grain in the food can be inferred by the placement of the grain in the ingredient list the whole grain should be the first ingredientor the second ingredient after water for foods with multiple wholegrain ingredients they should appear near the beginning of the ingredient list choose products with at least 50 percent of the total weight as wholegrain ingredients if a food has at least 8 grams of whole grains per ounceequivalent then half of the grains are wholegrain ingredients most americans meet recommendations for total grain intakes although 98 percent fall below recommendations for whole grains and 74 percent exceed limits for refined grains almost half of all intake of refined grains is from mixed dishes such as sandwiches burgers tacos pizza macaroni and cheese and spaghetti with meatballs about 20 percent of intake of refined grains comes from snacks and sweets including crackers pretzels cakes cookies and other grain desserts the remaining refined grains are generally eaten as separate food items such as pancakes cereals breads tortillas pasta or rice about 60 percent of wholegrain intake in the united states is from individual food items mostly cereals and crackers rather than mixed dishes grains are generally consumed in forms with higher amounts of sodium eg breads tortillas crackers and added sugars eg grain based desserts many readytoeat breakfast cereals rather than the nutrientdense forms further grains are often consumed as part of mixed dishes such as pasta dishes casseroles and sandwiches that may have other ingredients that are not in nutrientdense forms shifting from refined to wholegrain versions of commonly consumed foodssuch as from white to 100 wholewheat breads and white to brown rice where culturally appropriatewould increase wholegrain intakes and lower refined grain intakes to help meet recommendations additionally shifting to more nutrient dense forms of grains such as readytoeat breakfast cereals with less sugar will help meet healthy dietary patterns with careful planning limited amounts of salt butter or sources of added sugars can be used to make 3 guideline page 33 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 1 nutrition and health across the lifespan 3 guideline some grainbased foods more palatable while staying within calorie and nutrient limits but most grains should be eaten in their most nutrientdense forms reducing intakes of cakes cookies and other grain desserts will also support reducing refined grain intakes and staying within calorie needs dairy and fortified soy alternatives healthy dietary patterns feature dairy including fatfree and lowfat 1 milk yogurt and cheese individuals who are lactose intolerant can choose lowlactose and lactosefree dairy products for individuals who choose dairy alternatives fortified soy beverages commonly known as soy milk and soy yogurtwhich are fortified with calcium vitamin a and vitamin dare included as part of the dairy group because they are similar to milk and yogurt based on nutrient composition and in their use in meals other products sold as milks but made from plants eg almond rice coconut oat and hemp milks may contain calcium and be consumed as a source of calcium but they are not included as part of the dairy group because their overall nutritional content is not similar to dairy milk and fortified soy beverages therefore consuming these beverages does not contribute to meeting the dairy group recommendation about 90 percent of the us population does not meet dairy recommendations the percent of americans who drink milk as a beverage on a given day is 65 percent among young children 34 percent in adolescents and about 20 percent for adults dairy is generally consumed in forms with higher amounts of sodium eg cheeses as part of mixed dishes such as sandwiches pizza and pasta dishes and saturated fat eg higher fat milks and yogurts and can be a source of added sugars such as flavored milk ice cream and sweetened yogurts most individuals would benefit by increasing intake of dairy in fatfree or lowfat forms whether from milk including lactosefree milk yogurt and cheese or from fortified soy beverages or soy yogurt strategies to increase dairy intake include drinking fatfree or lowfat milk or a fortified soy beverage with meals or incorporating unsweetened fatfree or lowfat yogurt into breakfast or snacks protein foods healthy dietary patterns include a variety of protein foods in nutrientdense forms the protein foods group comprises a broad group of foods from both animal and plant sources and includes several subgroups meats poultry and eggs seafood and nuts seeds and soy products as noted previously beans peas and lentils may be considered a part of the protein foods group as well as the vegetable group protein also is found in some foods from other food groups such as dairy meats and poultry vary in fat content and include both fresh and processed forms most intake of meats and poultry should be from fresh frozen or canned and in lean forms eg chicken breast or ground turkey versus processed meats eg hot dogs sausages ham luncheon meats a healthy vegetarian dietary pattern can be achieved by incorporating protein foods from plants compared with the healthy usstyle dietary pattern the healthy vegetarian dietary pattern is higher in soy products particularly tofu and other processed soy products beans peas and lentils nuts and seeds and whole grains inclusion of dairy and eggs make this an example of a lactoovo vegetarian pattern meats poultry and seafood are not included seafood which includes fish and shellfish is a protein foods subgroup that provides beneficial fatty acids eg eicosapentaenoic acid epa and docosahexaenoic acid dha in addition mercury in the form of methylmercury is found in seafood in varying levels the us food and drug administration fda and the us environmental protection agency epa provide dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 1 nutrition and health across the lifespan page 34 3 guideline joint advice regarding seafood consumption to limit methylmercury exposure for women who might become or are pregnant or lactating and young children2 seafood choices higher in epa and dha and lower in methylmercury are encouraged seafood varieties commonly consumed in the united states that are higher in epa and dha and lower in methylmercury include salmon anchovies sardines pacific oysters and trout tilapia shrimp catfish crab and flounder are commonly consumed varieties that also are lower in methylmercury intakes of protein foods are close to the target amounts but many americans do not meet recommendations for specific protein subgroups about threequarters of americans meet or exceed the recommendation for meats poultry and eggs however almost 90 percent do not meet the recommendation for seafood and more than half do not meet the recommendation for nuts seeds and soy products slightly less than half 43 of all protein foods are consumed as a separate food item such as a chicken breast a steak an egg a fish filet or peanuts about the same proportion are consumed as part of a mixed dish 48 with the largest amount from sandwiches including burgers and tacos protein foods are generally consumed in forms with higher amounts of saturated fat or sodium and often part of mixed dishes eg sandwiches casseroles pasta dishes that include other ingredients that are not in nutrientdense forms shifts are needed within the protein foods group to add variety to subgroup intakes selecting from the seafood subgroup or the beans peas and lentils subgroup more often could help meet recommendations while still ensuring adequate protein consumption replacing processed or highfat meats eg hot dogs sausages bacon with seafood could help lower intake of saturated fat and sodium nutrients that are often consumed in excess of recommended limits replacing processed or highfat meats with beans peas and lentils would have similar benefits as well as increasing dietary fiber a dietary component of public health concern 2 available at fdagovfishadvice and epagovfishadvice follow

for americans 20202025 chapter 1 nutrition and health across the lifespan oils oils are important to consider as part of a healthy dietary pattern as they provide essential fatty acids commonly consumed oils include canola corn olive peanut safflower soybean and sunflower oils oils also are naturally present in nuts seeds seafood olives and avocados the fat in some tropical plants such as coconut oil palm kernel oil and palm oil are not included in the oils category because they contain a higher percentage of saturated fat than do other oils strategies to shift intake include cooking with vegetable oil in place of fats high in saturated fat including butter shortening lard or coconut oil however some foods such as desserts and sweet snacks that are prepared with oils instead of fats high in saturated fat are still high in added sugars and are thus not a nutrientdense food choice beverages when choosing beverages in a healthy dietary pattern both the calories and nutrients that they provide are important considerations beverages that are caloriefreeespecially wateror that contribute beneficial nutrients such as fatfree and lowfat milk and 100 juice should be the primary beverages consumed coffee tea and flavored waters also are options but the most nutrientdense options for these beverages include little if any sweeteners or cream for discussion on sugarsweetened

across food groups has resulted in underconsumption of some nutrients and dietary components calcium potassium dietary fiber and vitamin d are considered dietary components of public health concern for the general us population because low intakes are associated with health concerns additional dietary components that are underconsumed during specific life stages are highlighted in subsequent chapters if a healthy dietary pattern is consumed amounts of calcium potassium and dietary fiber can meet recommendations individuals should be encouraged to make shifts to increase the intake of vegetables fruits beans whole grains and dairy to move intakes of these underconsumed dietary components closer to recommendations in some cases fortified foods and dietary supplements may be useful in providing one or more nutrients that otherwise may be consumed in less than recommended amounts vitamin d recommendations are harder to achieve through natural sources from diet alone and would require consuming foods and beverages fortified with vitamin d in many cases taking a vitamin d supplement may be appropriate especially when sunlight exposure is limited due to climate or the use of

calories consumed offers a small amount of leeway to add minimal amounts of added sugars or saturated fat to the diet for example one way to use remaining calories is to add small amounts of added sugars or saturated fat to some nutrientdense foods to help make some foods more palatable while working towards meeting food group recommendationsfor example oatmeal with a small amount of brown sugar or vegetables prepared with small amounts of butter however to achieve a healthy dietary pattern all or mostly all food group recommendations should be met with foods and beverages that are in nutrientdense forms a healthy dietary pattern has little room available for foods and beverages high in added sugars saturated fat andor sodium intakes of foods and beverages high in these components should be limited these foods and beverages should be occasional choices consumed in small portions while intakes of added sugars saturated fat and sodium should be limited the guidance below is intended to allow programs and individuals to have some flexibility to choose a healthy dietary pattern within calorie limits that fits personal preferences and cultural traditionsand allows daytoday flexibility to support a healthy dietary pattern over time additionally if alcoholic beverages are consumed intakes should be within the limits described in this chapter and calories should be accounted for to keep total calorie intake at an appropriate level added sugars a healthy dietary pattern limits added sugars to less than 10 percent of calories per day added sugars can help with preservation contribute to functional attributes such as viscosity texture body color and browning capability andor help improve the palatability of some nutrientdense foods in fact the nutrient dense choices included in the healthy usstyle dietary pattern are based on availability in the us food supply and include 1750 calories from added sugars or 152 percent of total calories foods and beverages high in calories from added sugars should be limited to help achieve healthy dietary patterns within calorie limits when added sugars in foods and beverages exceed 10 percent of calories a healthy dietary pattern within calories limits is very difficult to achieve most americans have less than 8 percent of calories available for added sugars including the added sugars inherent to a healthy dietary pattern the limit for added sugars is based on the following assumptions 4 guideline dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 1 nutrition and health across the lifespan page 42 4 guideline most calorie levels have less than 15 percent of calories remaining after meeting food group recommendations through nutrientdense choices approximately half of remaining calories are consumed as saturated fat and half consumed as added sugars total saturated fat intakes meet the recommendation for less than 10 percent of total calorie intake no alcoholic beverages are consumed overall calorie intake does not exceed intake needs to maintain or achieve a healthy weight based on the assumptions above an individual who needs 2000 calories per day based on age sex and physical activity level has less than 7 percent of calories available for added sugars individuals who need 2800 calories per day or less have less than 8 percent of calories available for added sugars individuals who need more than 3000 calories may have a total of 9 to 10 percent of calories available for added sugars in this portion of the population that requires high calorie intake an upper limit of 10 percent of calories from added sugars may be consumed while still meeting food group recommendations in nutrient dense forms the 10 percent added sugar limit allows for flexibility in food choices over time but also requires careful planning for example if one chooses to eat less than the allotted amount of calories for saturated fat 10 percent of added sugars may fit in a healthy dietary pattern added sugars account on average for almost 270 caloriesor more than 13 percent of total caloriesper day in the us population as shown in figure 110 the major sources of added sugars in typical us diets are sugarsweetened beverages desserts and sweet snacks sweetened coffee and tea and candy together these food categories make up more than half of the intake of all added sugars while contributing very little to food group recommendations individuals have many potential options for reducing the intake of added sugars including reducing the intake of major sources of added sugars strategies include reducing portions consuming these items less often and selecting options low in added sugars for those with a weight loss goal limiting intake of foods and beverages high in added sugars is a strategy to help reduce calorie intake it should be noted that replacing added sugars with low and nocalorie sweeteners may reduce calorie intake in the shortterm and aid in weight management yet questions remain about their effectiveness as a longterm weight management strategy for additional information about highintensity sweeteners permitted for use in food in the united

particularly polyunsaturated fats although some saturated fat is inherent in foods eg highfat meat some sources are added eg butter on toast similar to added sugars some of the nutrientdense choices included in the healthy usstyle dietary pattern include saturated fat approximately 5 percent of total calories inherent to the nutrientdense foods in the healthy usstyle dietary pattern are from saturated fat from sources such as lean meat poultry and eggs nuts and seeds grains and saturated fatty acids in oils as such there is little room to include additional saturated fat in a healthy dietary pattern while staying within limits for saturated fat and total calories current average intakes of saturated fat are 11 percent of calories only 23 percent of individuals consume amounts of saturated fat consistent with the limit of less than 10 percent of calories the main sources of saturated fat in the us diet include sandwiches including burgers tacos and burritos desserts and sweet snacks and rice pasta and other grainbased mixed dishes figure 111 saturated fat is commonly found in higher amounts in highfat meat fullfat dairy products eg whole milk ice cream cheese butter coconut oil and palm kernel and palm oil strategies to lower saturated fat intake include reducing intakes of dessert and sweet snacks by consuming smaller portion sizes and eating these foods less often additional strategies include reading food labels to choose packaged foods lower in saturated fats and choosing lower fat forms of foods and beverages eg fatfree or lowfat milk instead of 2 percent or whole milk lean rather than fatty cuts of meat when cooking and purchasing meals select lean meat and lower fat cheese in place of highfat meats and regular cheeseor replace them with ingredients with oils such as nuts seeds or avocado cook and purchase products made with oils higher in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat eg canola corn olive peanut safflower soybean and sunflower rather than butter shortening or coconut or palm oils a note on trans fats and dietary cholesterol the national academies recommends that trans fat and dietary cholesterol consumption to be as low as possible without compromising the nutritional adequacy of the diet the usda dietary patterns are limited in trans fats and low in dietary cholesterol cholesterol and a small amount of trans fat occur naturally in some animal source foods as of june 2018 partially hydrogenated oils phos the major source of artificial trans fat in the food supply are no longer generally recognized as safe

intakes for those ages 1 and older is 3393 milligrams per day with a range of about 2000 to 5000 mg per day only a small proportion of total sodium intake is from sodium inherent in foods or from salt added in home cooking or at the table most sodium consumed in the united states comes from salt added during commercial food processing and preparation including foods prepared at restaurants sodium is found in foods from almost all food categories across the food supply figure 112 including mixed dishes such as sandwiches burgers and tacos rice pasta and grain dishes pizza meat poultry and seafood dishes and soups calorie intake is highly associated with sodium intake ie the more foods and beverages people consume the more sodium they tend to consume because sodium is found in so many foods multiple strategies should be implemented to reduce sodium intake to the recommended limits careful choices are needed in all food groups to reduce intake strategies to lower sodium intake include cooking at home more often using the nutrition facts label to choose products with less sodium reduced sodium or nosaltadded etc and flavoring foods with herbs and spices instead of salt based

does not recommend that individuals who do not drink alcohol start drinking for any reason there are also some people who should not drink at all such as if they are pregnant or might be pregnant under the legal age for drinking if they have certain medical conditions or are taking certain medications that can interact with alcohol and if they are recovering from an alcohol use disorder or if they are unable to control the amount they drink if adults age 21 years and older choose to drink alcoholic beverages drinking less is better for health than drinking more evidence indicates that among those who drink higher average alcohol consumption is associated with an increased risk of death from all causes compared with lower average alcohol consumption alcohol misuse or consuming alcohol in excess of recommendations increases risk of several other conditions such as liver disease cardiovascular disease injuries and alcohol use disorders for the purposes of evaluating amounts of alcohol that may be consumed the dietary guidelines defines drink equivalents one alcoholic drink equivalent is defined as containing 14 grams 06 fl oz of pure alcohol the following count as one alcoholic drink equivalent 12 fluid ounces of regular beer 5 alcohol 5 fluid ounces of wine 12 alcohol or 15 fluid ounces of 80 proof distilled spirits 40 alcohol to help americans move toward a healthy dietary pattern and minimize risks associated with drinking adults of legal drinking age can choose not to drink or to drink in moderation by limiting intakes to 2 drinks or less in a day for men and 1 drink or less in a day for women on days when alcohol is consumed this is not intended as an average over several days but rather the amount consumed on any single day binge drinking3 defined as 5 or more drinks for the typical adult male or 4 or more drinks for the typical adult female in about 2 hours should be avoided emerging evidence suggests that even drinking within the recommended limits may increase the overall risk of death from various causes such as from several types of cancer and some forms of cardiovascular disease alcohol has been found to increase risk for cancer and for some types of cancer the risk increases even at low levels of alcohol consumption less than 1 drink in a day caution therefore is recommended alcoholic beverages are not a component of the usda dietary patterns the amount of alcohol and calories in beverages varies and should be accounted for within the limits of healthy dietary patterns so that calorie limits are not exceeded see calories in alcoholic beverages approximately 60 percent of adults report alcoholic beverage consumption in the past month of those approximately 30 percent binge drink sometimes multiple times per month during days when men and women consume alcohol their consumption typically exceeds current guidance among adults including those who do not drink alcoholic beverages contribute approximately 5 percent of calorie intake 3 to 4 of calories for women and 5 to 7 for men this translates into approximately 9 percent of calories among those who drink as such among those who drink alcoholic beverages alone account for most of the calories that remain after meeting food group recommendations in nutrientdense formsleaving very few calories for added sugars or saturated fat adults who choose to drink and are not among the individuals listed above who should not drink are encouraged to limit daily intakes to align with the dietary guidelinesand to consider calories from alcoholic beverages so as not to exceed daily calorie limits 3 more information is available at niaaanihgovalcoholhealthoverviewalcoholconsumptionmoderatebingedrinking 4 guideline calories in alcoholic beverages alcoholic beverages supply calories but few nutrients and calories from alcoholic beverages should be accounted for to keep total calorie intake at an appropriate level alcoholic beverages may contain calories from both alcohol and other ingredients such as soda juice and added sugars it is important to consider ingredients and portion size the range of calories in cocktails varies widely depending on serving size and ingredients examples of calories contained in alcoholic beverages include 12 fluid ounces of regular beer 5 alcohol about 150 calories 5 fluid ounces of wine 12

page 50 4 guideline support healthy dietary patterns for all americans everyone has a role to play to support access to healthy foods and beverages in multiple settings nationwide where people live learn work play and gather having access to healthy safe and affordable food is crucial for an individual to achieve a healthy dietary pattern concerted efforts within communities businesses and industries organizations government and other segments of society are needed to support individuals and families in making lifestyle choices that align with the dietary guidelines food manufacturers and retail establishments can support americans in achieving a healthy dietary pattern by providing healthy options in all the places where foods and beverages are purchased during the past few decades food products and menus have evolved substantially in response to consumer demand and public health concerns food reformulation and menu and retail modification opportunities include offering more vegetables fruits whole grains lowfat and fatfree dairy and a greater variety of protein foods that are nutrient dense while also reducing sodium and added sugars reducing saturated fat and replacing it with unsaturated fats and reducing added refined starches portion sizes also can be reduced to help individuals make choices that better fit within their calorie needs food manufacturers are encouraged to consider the entire composition of the food or beverage and not just individual nutrients or ingredients when developing or reformulating products similarly when developing or modifying menus establishments can consider the range of offerings both within and across food groups and other dietary components to determine whether the healthy options offered reflect the proportions in healthy dietary patterns in taking these actions care should be taken to assess any potential unintended consequences so that as changes are made to better align with the dietary guidelines undesirable changes are not introduced for example a change made to reduce the amount of added sugars in a product should not come at the expense of increasing the amount of saturated fat or sodium food access is influenced by diverse factors such as proximity to food retail outlets eg the number and types of stores in an area ability to prepare ones own meals or eat independently and the availability of personal or public transportation the underlying socioeconomic characteristics of a neighborhood also may influence an individuals ability to access foods to support healthy eating patterns in 2019 105 percent of households were food insecure at least some time during the year food insecurity occurs when access to nutritionally adequate and safe food is limited or uncertain food insecurity can be temporary or persist over time preventing individuals and families from following a healthy dietary pattern that aligns with the dietary guidelines the prevalence of food insecurity typically rises during times of economic downturn as households experience greater hardship government and nongovernment nutrition assistance programs help alleviate food insecurity and play an essential role by providing food meals and educational resources so that participants can make healthy food choices within their budget chapters 2 3 4 5 and 6 highlight examples of these resources at each life stage as discussed in subsequent chapters everyone has an important role in leading disease prevention efforts within their organizations and communities to make healthy eating an organizational and societal norm changes at multiple levels of society are needed and these changes in combination and over time can have a meaningful impact on the health of current and future generations looking toward the life stages this chapter has provided guidance about the fundamentals of a healthy dietary pattern these fundamentals are remarkably consistent across life stages even though each stage also has its own specific nutrition considerations the following chapters build on this chapter and take a closer look at each of the life stages chapter 2 provides a focused

childs second birthday is a critically important period for proper growth and development it also is key for establishing healthy dietary patterns that may influence the trajectory of eating behaviors and health throughout the life course during this period nutrients critical for brain development and growth must be provided in adequate amounts children in this age group consume small quantities of foods so its important to make every bite count key recommendations for about the first 6 months of life exclusively feed infants human milk continue to feed infants human milk through at least the first year of life and longer if desired feed infants ironfortified infant formula during the first year of life when human milk is unavailable provide infants with supplemental vitamin d beginning soon after birth at about 6 months introduce infants to nutrientdense complementary foods introduce infants to potentially allergenic foods along with other complementary foods encourage infants and toddlers to consume a variety of foods from all food groups include foods rich in iron and zinc particularly for infants fed human milk avoid foods and beverages with added sugars limit foods and beverages higher in sodium as infants wean from human milk or infant formula transition to a healthy dietary pattern birth through 23 months dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 2 infants and toddlers page 54 human milk feeding alone is the ideal form of nutrition from birth through about age 6 months human milk provides necessary nutrients protective factors against disease and other unique immunological benefits if human milk is unavailable infants should be fed an iron fortified commercial infant formula once an infant is developmentally ready foods and beverages should be introduced to complement human milk feeding these complementary foods and beverages are essential to meet the nutrient requirements of infants starting at about age 6 months and should be selected carefully to help meet these needs as an infant becomes a toddler and learns to eat a variety of foods flavors and textures the goal of complementary feeding becomes establishing a healthy dietary pattern and transitioning to a healthy family diet by age 2 putting the key recommendations into action feed infants human milk for the first 6 months if possible exclusive human milk feeding is one of the best ways to start an infant off on the path of lifelong healthy nutrition exclusive human milk feeding commonly referred to as exclusive breastfeeding refers to an infant consuming only human milk and not in combination with infant formula andor complementary foods or beverages including water except for medications or vitamin and mineral supplementation human milk can support an infants nutrient needs for about the first 6 months of life with the exception of vitamin d and potentially iron in addition to nutrients human milk includes bioactive substances and immunologic properties that support infant health and growth and development us data show that about 84 percent of infants born in 2017 were ever fed human milk with only 25 percent fed human milk exclusively through age 6 months and 35 percent continuing to be fed any human milk at age 12 months nearly onequarter of infants were fed some human milk beyond age 12 months with about 15 percent of toddlers being fed human milk at age 18 months families may have a number of reasons for not having human milk for their infant for example a family may choose not to breastfeed a child may be adopted or the mother may be unable to produce a full milk supply or may be unable to pump and store milk safely due to family or workplace pressures if human milk is unavailable infants should be fed an ironfortified commercial infant formula ie labeled with iron regulated by the us food and drug administration fda which is based on standards that ensure nutrient content and safety infant formulas are designed to meet the nutritional needs of infants and are not needed beyond age 12 months it is important to take precautions to ensure that expressed human milk and prepared infant formula are handled and stored safely see proper handling and storage of human milk and infant formula donor human milk if families do not have sufficient human milk for their infant but want to feed their infant human milk they may look for alternative ways to obtain it it is important for the family to obtain pasteurized donor human milk from a source such as an accredited human milk bank that has screened its donors and taken appropriate safety precautions when human milk is obtained directly from individuals or through the internet the donor is unlikely to have been screened for infectious diseases and it is unknown whether the human milk has been collected or stored in a way to reduce possible safety risks to the baby more information is available at fdagovscienceresearch pediatricsusedonorhumanmilk birth through 23 months page 55 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 2 infants and toddlers proper handling and storage of human milk and infant formula wash hands thoroughly before expressing human milk or preparing to feed human milk or infant formula if expressing human milk ensure pump parts are thoroughly cleaned before use if preparing powdered infant formula use a safe water source and follow instructions on the label refrigerate freshly expressed human milk within 4 hours for up to 4 days previously frozen and thawed human milk should be used within 24 hours thawed human milk should never be refrozen refrigerate prepared infant formula for up to 24 hours do not use a microwave to warm human milk or infant formula warm safely by placing the sealed container of human milk or infant formula in a bowl of warm water or under warm running tap water once it has been offered to the infant use or discard leftovers quickly within 2 hours for human milk or 1 hour for infant formula thoroughly wash all infant feeding items such as bottles and nipples consider sanitizing feeding items for infants younger than 3 months of age infants born prematurely or infants with a

b12 human milk has sufficient vitamin b12 to meet infant needs unless the mothers vitamin b12 status is inadequate this can occur for different reasons including when the mother eats a strictly vegan diet without any animal source foods when the mother is at risk of vitamin b12 deficiency human milk may not provide sufficient vitamin b12 in these cases the mother andor infant fed human milk may require a vitamin b12 supplement parents caregivers and guardians should consult with a healthcare provider to determine whether supplementation is necessary homemade infant formulas and those that are improperly and illegally imported into the united states without mandated fda review and supervision should not be used toddler milks or toddler formulas should not be fed to infants as they are not designed to meet the nutritional needs of infants provide infants supplemental vitamin d beginning soon after birth all infants who are fed human milk exclusively or who receive both human milk and infant formula mixed fed will need a vitamin d supplement of 400 iu per day beginning soon after birth infant formula is fortified with vitamin d thus when an infant is receiving full feeds of infant formula vitamin d supplementation is not needed families who do not wish to provide a supplement directly to their infant should discuss with a healthcare provider the risks and benefits of maternal high dose supplementation options even when consuming a varied diet achieving adequate vitamin d from foods and beverages natural sources alone is challenging suggesting that young children may need to continue taking a vitamin d supplement after age 12 months parents caregivers and guardians should consult with a healthcare provider to determine how long supplementation is necessary introduce infants to nutrientdense complementary foods at about 6 months old at about age 6 months infants should be introduced to nutrientdense developmentally appropriate foods to complement human milk or infant formula feedings some infants may show developmental signs of readiness before age 6 months see developmental readiness for beginning to eat solid foods but introducing complementary foods before age 4 months is not recommended waiting until after age 6 months to introduce foods also is not recommended starting around that time complementary foods are necessary to ensure adequate nutrition and exposure to flavors textures and different types of foods infants should be given age and developmentally appropriate foods to help prevent choking it is important to introduce potentially allergenic foods along with other complementary foods for infants fed human milk it is particularly important to include complementary foods that are rich in iron and zinc when starting complementary foods see appendix 1 nutritional goals for agesex groups about onethird 32 of infants in the united states are introduced to complementary foods and beverages before age 4 months highlighting the importance of providing guidance and support to parents guardians and caregivers on the timing of introduction to complementary foods early introduction of complementary foods and beverages is higher among infants receiving infant formula 42 or a combination of infant formula and human milk 32 than among infants exclusively fed human milk 19 birth through 23 months page 57 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 2 infants and toddlers developmental readiness for beginning to eat solid foods the age at which infants reach different developmental stages will vary typically between age 4 and 6 months infants develop the gross motor oral and fine motor skills necessary to begin to eat complementary foods as an infants oral skills develop the thickness and texture of foods can gradually be varied signs that an infant is ready for complementary foods include being able to control head and neck sitting up alone or with support bringing objects to the mouth trying to grasp small objects such as toys or food swallowing food rather than pushing it back out onto the chin infants and young children should be given age and developmentally appropriate foods to help prevent choking foods such as hot dogs candy nuts and seeds raw carrots grapes popcorn and chunks of peanut butter are some of the foods that can be a choking risk for young children parents guardians and caregivers are encouraged to take steps to decrease choking risks including offering foods in the appropriate size consistency and shape that will allow an infant or young child to eat and swallow easily making sure the infant or young child is sitting up in a high chair or other safe supervised place ensuring an adult is supervising feeding during mealtimes not putting infant cereal or other solid foods in an infants bottle this could increase the risk of choking and will not make the infant sleep longer more information on foods that can present choking hazards is

introduce infants to potentially allergenic foods along with other complementary foods potentially allergenic foods eg peanuts egg cow milk products tree nuts wheat crustacean shellfish fish and soy should be introduced when other complementary foods are introduced to an infants diet introducing peanutcontaining foods in the first year reduces the risk that an infant will develop a food allergy to peanuts cow milk as a beverage should be introduced at age 12 months or later see establish a healthy beverage pattern there is no evidence that delaying introduction of allergenic foods beyond when other complementary foods are introduced helps to prevent food allergy for more information see for infants at high risk of peanut allergy introduce peanutcontaining foods at age 4 to 6 months for infants at high risk of peanut allergy introduce peanutcontaining foods at age 4 to 6 months if an infant has severe eczema egg allergy or both conditions that increase the risk of peanut allergy ageappropriate peanut containing foods should be introduced into the diet as early as age 4 to 6 months this will reduce the risk of developing peanut allergy caregivers should check with the infants healthcare provider before feeding the infant peanut containing foods a blood test or skin prick may be recommended to determine whether peanut should be introduced to the infant and if so the safest way to introduce it more information is available in the addendum guidelines for the prevention of peanut allergy in the united states at niaidnihgov sitesdefaultfilesaddendum peanutallergyprevention guidelinespdf birth through 23 months page 59 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 2 infants and toddlers encourage infants and toddlers to consume a variety of complementary foods and beverages to meet energy and nutrient needs parents caregivers and guardians are encouraged to introduce foods across all the food groupsas described below and carrying forward the principles in chapter 1including items that fit within a familys preferences cultural traditions and budget complementary foods and beverages should be rich in nutrients meet calorie and nutrient requirements during this critical period of growth and development and stay within limits of dietary components such as added sugars and sodium although the dietary guidelines does not provide a recommended dietary pattern for infants ages 6 through 11 months infants should be on the path to a healthy dietary pattern that is recommended for those ages 12 through 23 months see appendix 3 usda dietary patterns in the united states some dietary components are of public health concern for infants and toddlers iron is a dietary component of public health concern for underconsumption among older infants ages 6 through 11 months who are fed primarily human milk and consume inadequate iron from complementary foods older infants who are fed primarily human milk also underconsume zinc and protein from complementary foods and vitamin d choline and potassium are notably underconsumed by all older infants during the second year of life the dietary components of public health concern for underconsumption are vitamin d calcium dietary fiber and potassium and for overconsumption are added sugars and sodium lists of dietary sources of iron calcium potassium dietary fiber and vitamin d are available at dietaryguidelinesgov introduce ironrich foods to infants starting at about 6 months old ironrich foods eg meats and seafood rich in heme iron and ironfortified infant cereals are important components of the infants diet from age 6 through 11 months to maintain adequate iron status which supports neurologic development and immune function infants are typically born with body stores of iron adequate for about the first 6 months of life depending on gestational age maternal iron status and timing of umbilical cord clamping by age 6 months however infants require an external source of iron apart from human milk caregivers of infants exclusively fed human milk should talk with their pediatric care provider about whether there may be a need for infants supplementation with iron before age 6 months a complementary food source of iron beginning at about 6 months is particularly important for infants fed human milk because the iron content of human milk is low and maternal iron intake during lactation does not increase its content in the united states an estimated 77 percent of infants fed human milk have inadequate iron intake during the second half of infancy highlighting the importance of introducing ironrich foods starting at age 6 months infants receiving most of their milk feeds as iron fortified infant formula are likely to need less iron from complementary foods beginning at 6 months of age after birth through 23 months dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 2 infants and toddlers page 60 age 12 months children have a lower iron requirement but good food sources of iron are still needed to maintain adequate iron status and prevent deficiency introduce zincrich foods to infants starting at about 6 months old zincrich complementary foods eg meats beans zinc fortified infant cereals are important from age 6 months onwards to support adequate zinc status which supports growth and immune function although the zinc content of human milk is initially high and efficiently absorbed the concentration declines over the first 6 months of lactation and is not affected by maternal zinc intake during the second half of infancy approximately half 54 of us infants fed human milk have inadequate zinc intake prioritizing zincrich foods starting at 6 months of age to complement human milk feedings will help infants meet their requirement for zinc encourage a variety of foods from all food groups to infants starting at about 6 months old to support nutrient adequacy foster acceptance of healthy foods and set intakes on a path toward a healthy pattern it is important to encourage foods from all food groups because very young children are being exposed to new textures and flavors for the first time it may take up to 8 to 10 exposures for an infant to accept a new type of food repeated offering of foods such as fruits and vegetables increases the likelihood of an infant accepting them a nutrientdense diverse diet from age 6 through 23 months of life includes a variety of food sources from each food group protein foods including meats poultry eggs seafood nuts seeds and soy products are important sources of iron zinc protein choline and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids the longchain polyunsaturated fatty acids specifically the essential omega3 and omega6 fatty acids supplied through seafood nuts seeds and oils influence the infants fatty acid status and are among the key nutrients needed for the rapid brain development that occurs through the infants first 2 years of life some types of fish such as salmon and trout are also natural sources of vitamin d to limit exposure to methylmercury from seafood the us food and drug administration and the us environmental protection agency issued joint guidance regarding the types of seafood to choose1 vegetables and fruits especially those rich in potassium vitamin a and vitamin c should be offered to infants and toddlers age 6 through 23 months the vegetable subgroup of beans peas and lentils also provides a good source of protein and dietary fiber for dairy families can introduce yogurt and cheese including soybased yogurt before 12 months however infants should not consume cow milk as a beverage or fortified soy beverage before age 12 months as a replacement for human milk or infant formula see cow milk and fortified soy beverages in the second year of life when calcium requirements increase dairy products including milk yogurt cheese and fortified soy beverages and soy yogurt provide a good source of calcium vitamin dfortified milk and soy beverages also provide a good source of vitamin d for those younger than the age of 2 offer dairy products without added sugar see avoid added sugars grains including ironfortified infant cereal play an important role in meeting nutrient needs during this life stage infant cereals fortified with iron include oat barley multigrain and rice cereals rice cereal fortified with iron is a good source of nutrients for infants but rice cereal shouldnt be the only type of cereal given to infants offering young children whole grains more often than refined grains will increase dietary fiber as well as potassium intake during the second year of life and help young children establish healthy dietary practices 1 us food and drug administration and us

toddlers dietary components to limit while encouraging intake from each food group some dietary components should be limited avoid added sugars infants and young children have virtually no room in their diet for added sugars this is because the nutrient requirements for infants and young children are quite high relative to their size but the amount of complementary foods they consume is small complementary foods need to be nutrientdense and not contain additional calories from added sugars in addition low and nocalorie sweeteners which can also be called highintensity sweeteners are not recommended for children younger than age 2 taste preferences are being formed during this time period and infants and young children may develop preferences for overly sweet foods if introduced to very sweet foods during this timeframe for more information on added sugars see chapter 1 avoid foods higher in sodium sodium is found in a number of foods including some salty snacks commercial toddler foods and processed meats in addition to keeping sodium intake within limits for toddlers see appendix 1 another reason to avoid highsodium foods is that taste preferences for salty food may be established early in life choose fresh or lowsodium frozen foods when available and lowsodium canned foods to minimize sodium content for more information on sodium see chapter 1 avoid honey and unpasteurized foods and beverages infants should not be given any foods containing raw or cooked honey honey can contain the clostridium botulinum organism that could cause serious illness or death among infants infants and young children also should not be given any unpasteurized foods or beverages such as unpasteurized juices milk yogurt or cheeses as they could contain harmful bacteria establish a healthy beverage pattern an important part of establishing an overall healthy dietary pattern is careful consideration of beverages guidance for different beverage categories is provided below water for healthy infants with adequate intake of human milk or infant formula supplemental water is typically not needed in the first 6 months small amounts up to 4 to 8 ounces per day of plain fluoridated drinking water can be given to infants with the introduction of complementary foods plain fluoridated drinking water intake can slowly be increased after age 1 to meet hydration and fluoride needs birth through 23 months dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 2 infants and toddlers page 62 cow milk and fortified soy beverages infants should not consume cow milk or fortified soy beverages before age 12 months to replace human milk or infant formula cow milk does not have the correct amount of nutrients for infants and its higher protein and mineral content are hard for an infants kidneys and digestive system to process plain cow milk whole milk or fortified unsweetened soy beverage can be offered beginning around 12 months of age to help meet calcium potassium vitamin d and protein needs flavored milks for children age 12 through 23 months should be avoided because they contain added sugars plantbased milk alternatives plantbased milk alternatives which are sometimes referred to as milk alternatives include beverages made from plants such as soy oat rice coconut and almond these beverages should not be used in the first year of life to replace human milk or infant formula they may come in different flavors and some forms have added sugars unsweetened versions of these beverages may be accommodated in small amounts in the diet during the second year of life but most have significantly less protein than cow milk and are not always fortified with calcium and vitamin d among plantbased milk alternatives only fortified soy beverage is currently considered a dairy equivalent thus consuming other plantbased beverages does not contribute to meeting dairy recommendations 100 fruit juice before age 12 months 100 fruit or vegetable juices should not be given to infants in the second year of life fruit juice is not necessary and most fruit intake should come from eating whole fruit if 100 fruit juice is provided up to 4 ounces per day can fit in a healthy dietary pattern juices that contain added sugars should be avoided toddler milk and toddler drinks there are no clear needs for toddler milks or drinks needed nutrients can be obtained from cow milk or fortified soy beverage and appropriate solid foods toddler milks and toddler drinks are drinks supplemented with nutrients and typically contain added sugars a variety of nutrientdense complementary foods and beverages without added sugars should be emphasized for achieving nutrient recommendations sugarsweetened beverages sugarsweetened beverages eg regular soda juice drinks not 100 fruit juice sports drinks and flavored water with sugar should not be given to children younger than age 2 drinks labeled as fruit drinks or fruitflavored drinks are not the same as 100 fruit juice and contain added sugars these beverages displace nutrientdense beverages and foods in the diet of young children infants and toddlers do not have room in their diets for the additional calories from added sugars found in these beverages in addition sugarsweetened beverage intake in infancy and early childhood may predispose children to consume more of these beverages later in life caffeinated beverages concerns exist about potential negative health effects of caffeine for young children and no safe limits of caffeine have been established for this age group caffeine is a stimulant that can occur naturally in foods and beverages or as an additive major sources of caffeine for americans include beverages such as soft drinks tea coffee and sports drinks beverages containing caffeine should be avoided for children younger than age 2 birth through 23 months page 63 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 2 infants and toddlers healthy dietary pattern during a toddlers second year of life in the second year of life toddlers consume less human milk and infant formula is not recommended calories and nutrients should predominantly be met from a healthy dietary pattern of ageappropriate foods and beverages the healthy usstyle dietary pattern presented here is intended for toddlers ages 12 through 23 months who no longer consume human milk or infant formula the pattern represents the types and amounts of foods needed to meet energy and nutrition requirements for this period table 21 for toddlers who are still consuming human milk approximately onethird at 12 months and 15 percent at 18 months a healthy dietary pattern should include a similar combination of nutrientdense complementary foods and beverages table 21 displays the healthy usstyle dietary pattern to illustrate the specific amounts and limits for food groups and other dietary components that make up healthy dietary patterns the pattern is provided at calorie levels ranging from 700 to 1000 calories per day which are appropriate for most toddlers ages 12 through 23 months see appendix 2 estimated calorie needs a healthy dietary pattern includes a variety of nutrientdense fruits vegetables grains protein foods including lean meats poultry eggs seafood nuts and seeds dairy including milk yogurt and cheese and oils based on fda and epas joint advice about eating fish young children should eat seafood lowest in methylmercury and certain species of seafood should be avoided2 if young children are lower in body weight they should eat less seafood than the amounts in the healthy usstyle dietary pattern more information is available on the fda or epa websites at fdagovfishadvice and epagov fishadvice after food group and subgroup recommendations are met a small number of calories are allocated to oils the recommendation to limit saturated fat to less than 10 percent of calories per day does not apply to those younger than age 2 and the inclusion of higher fat versions of dairy is a notable difference in the pattern for toddlers ages 12 through 23 months compared to patterns for ages 2 and older however no calories remain in the pattern for additional saturated fat or for added sugars to illustrate the concept of nutrient density figure 21 shows examples of foods and beverages appropriate for this life stage in forms that are not in nutrientdense forms compared to those that are in nutrientdense forms this dietary pattern requires careful choices of foods and beverages but does not require inclusion of fortified products specifically formulated for infants or toddlers to meet nutrient recommendations figure 21 make healthy shifts to empower toddlers to eat nutrientdense foods in dietary patterns science shows that early food preferences influence later food choices make the first choice the healthiest choices that set the toddlers on a path of making nutrientdense choices in the years to come examples of shifts in common choices to healthier more nutrientdense food choices include cereal with added sugars cereal with minimal added sugars fruit products with added sugars fruit eg canned in 100 juice roasted

infant formula is included in appendix 3 this pattern describes a lactoovo vegetarian diet that includes regular consumption of eggs dairy products soy products and nuts or seeds in addition to vegetables including beans peas and lentils fruits grains and oils iron may be of particular concern because plant source foods contain only nonheme iron which is less bioavailable than is heme iron food source lists for both heme and nonheme iron are available at dietaryguidelinesgov vitamin b12 also may be of concern because it is present only in animal source foods when feeding infants and toddlers a lactoovo vegetarian diet parents caregivers and guardians should consult with a healthcare provider to determine whether supplementation of iron vitamin b12 andor other nutrients is necessary and if so appropriate levels to meet their unique needs supporting healthy eating parents guardians and caregivers play an important role in nutrition during this life stage because infants and toddlers are fully reliant on them for their needs in addition to what to feed children how to feed young children also is critical as noted above repeated exposure to foods can increase acceptance of new foods another important concept is responsive feeding a feeding style that emphasizes recognizing and responding to the hunger or fullness cues of an infant or young child see responsive feeding responsive feeding responsive feeding is a term used to describe a feeding style that emphasizes recognizing and responding to the hunger or fullness cues of an infant or young child responsive feeding helps young children learn how to self regulate their intake see table 22 for some examples of signs a child may show for hunger and fullness when he or she is a newborn through age 5 months and signs a child may start to show between age 6 through 23 months it is important to listen to the childs hunger and fullness cues to build healthy eating habits during this critical age if parents guardians or caregivers have questions or concerns a conversation with a healthcare provider will be helpful for more information on signs a child is hungry or full see

many resources exist to support healthy growth and development during infancy and toddlerhood these include the following government programs that aim to support a healthy dietary pattern for infants and toddlers living in households with limited incomes the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic supports infant and early childhood nutrition through supplementing the diets of women who are pregnant or lactating and by providing breastfeeding support and ironfortified infant formula when human milk is unavailable or fed only partially wic accommodates the transition to solid foods by providing nutrientdense foods in the supplemental food packages offered to older infants and toddlers nutrition education and counseling and referrals to healthcare and social services are other important resources offered to incomeeligible wic participants the child and adult care food program cacfp provides reimbursement for nutrientdense meals and snacks served to infants and toddlers in participating child care centers including at head start programs and day care homes where infants and toddlers also have access to health screenings and families can be connected to health services to support their overall wellbeing the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap is the largest food assistance program in the united states snap helps meet the nutritional needs of infants and toddlers living in lowincome households by providing temporary monthly benefits that can be used to access a healthy dietary pattern these government nutrition programs are especially important for the 14 percent3 of families with children who experience food insecurity and may struggle to access the foods needed to support a healthy dietary pattern professionals can use these and additional government and nongovernment resources that exist within communities to support healthy eating during infancy and toddlerhood looking toward chapter 3 children and adolescents this chapter focused on nutrition issues important to infants and toddlers exclusive human milk feeding if possible introducing nutrientdense complementary foods at about age 6 months and encouraging infants and toddlers to sample and consume a variety of nutrientdense foods and beverages to meet their needs as toddlers grow and their dietary patterns become more integrated with the familys food patterns new issues arise these issues and how to accommodate them within a lifelong healthy dietary pattern are discussed in the next chapter which focuses on children and adolescents 3 more information on food insecurity is available at ersusdagovdataproductsagand foodstatisticschartingtheessentialsfoodsecurityandnutritionassistance ages 218 page 69

hildren and adolescents include individuals ages 2 through 18 a life stage characterized by transitions and the formation of dietary patterns suboptimal current intake patterns among children and adolescents and inadequate physical activity contribute to overweight and obesity in this life stage and risk of chronic disease eg type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease later in life changing this trajectory is crucial because dietary patterns established during this life stage tend to continue into adult years healthy eating throughout this life stage involves the child or adolescent families and caregivers and institutions and settings where food is provided and consumed young children are fully reliant on others to provide their meals and snacks as children transition to schoolage and through adolescence they are exposed to new food choices and begin to have more autonomy in the foods that are selected new influences on eating behavior also emerge such as peer pressure which can create opportunities or challenges for establishing dietary patterns consistent with health and longevity adolescents acquire evergreater independence in their food choices as they mature with more time spent on their own with peers and more foods and beverages frequently consumed in social settings other factors that influence eating behavior include social supports exposure to food marketing and promotion and policies that determine community design youth have diverse calorie and nutrient needs based on age and patterns of growth development and physical activity current intake data of young children show some components of a healthy dietary pattern that continue from the infant and toddler life stages before these components of a healthy dietary pattern are established however diet quality worsens through childhood and into adolescence and intake patterns drift further from recommendations in the dietary guidelines active community support is needed to help youth meet food group and nutrient goals with nutrient dense foods and beverages ages 218 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 3 children and adolescents page 72 childhood overweight and obesity in the united states 41 percent of children and adolescents are overweight or have obesity and the prevalence is higher among hispanic and nonhispanic black children and adolescents as compared to nonhispanic asians and whites overweight and obesity put youth at high risk of serious health concerns youth with obesity are more likely to have immediate health risks including high blood pressure high cholesterol and impaired glucose tolerance they also are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes beginning as soon as the teenage years and into adulthood psychological eg anxiety depression and social concerns eg bullying stigma also are more likely in children and adolescents with overweight or obesity the causes of childhood obesity are complex and interconnected behaviors eg eating habits level of physical activity sedentary time and the community in which a child or adolescent resides can influence risk of obesity genetics and the fetal environment also play a role in the development of obesity however many opportunities exist to help prevent or manage overweight and obesity as children transition through these life stages the goal for children and adolescents with overweight or obesity is to reduce the rate of weight gain while allowing normal growth and development this can primarily be done by emphasizing nutrientdense food and beverage choices minimizing calories from sources that do not contribute to a healthy dietary pattern and encouraging regular physical activity healthy dietary patterns children and adolescents are encouraged to follow the recommendations on the types of foods and beverages that make up a healthy dietary pattern described in chapter 1 nutrition and health across the lifespan the guidelines and key recommendations tables 31 to 33 display the healthy usstyle dietary pattern to illustrate the specific amounts and limits for food groups and other dietary components that make up healthy dietary

establishing a firm foundation for lifelong health and wellbeing for youth regular physical activity can improve bone health cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness and cognition including academic achievement and reduce the symptoms of depression preschoolaged children should be active throughout the day to enhance growth and development adults caring for children during this age should encourage active play that includes a variety of activity types light moderate or vigorous intensity and aim for at least 3 hours per day schoolaged children and adolescents need at least 60 minutes of moderate tovigorous activity daily to attain the most health benefits from physical activity most activity can be aerobic like walking running or anything that makes their heart beat faster they

intake ranges of the subgroups for grains are represented in daily amounts subgroups for vegetables and protein foods are represented in weekly amounts see figures 32 34 36 and 38 current intakes show that from an early age dietary patterns are not aligned with the dietary guidelines the healthy eating index score of 61 out of 100 for children ages 2 through 4 indicates that overall diet quality is poor notably hei scores decline throughout childhood and adolescence with scores for adolescents approximately 10 points lower than those for young children figure 31 among children ages 2 through 4 consumption of total fruit is generally adequate for about 60 percent of children compared to other age groups a higher percentage of young children also have intakes of total vegetables at or above recommended levels the difference between recommended and actual intakes of total fruit and total vegetables emerges and expands as children age by late adolescence average fruit and vegetable consumption is about half of the recommended range of intake throughout youth starchy vegetables eg white potatoes cornoften in forms that are fried or prepared with additions such as butter and saltare more frequently consumed than the red and orange dark green or beans peas and lentils vegetable subgroups for fruit about 70 percent of intake comes from whole formsfresh canned frozen or driedand 100 juice which are often nutrientdense forms some fruit is consumed through sources that are not nutrientdense for example fruit as part of a baked dessert or juice drink figure 31 healthy

and adolescents is relatively stable across age groups beginning at age 9 the amount of dairy foods in a healthy dietary pattern increases from 2 \u00bd to 3 cup equivalents per day to support an increase in calcium intake that is needed during these life stages as a result average intake of dairy foods is close to or at recommended levels for children younger than age 9 while consumption among adolescents is typically below recommended intake levels although the gaps between recommended and current intakes widen throughout these life stages for some dietary components others principally whole grains and seafood are infrequently consumed by any youth whole grains are consumed below recommended levels even by young children as the difference between recommended and current intakes widens across age groups the types of refined and wholegrain foods consumed remains consistent mixed dishes such as pizza pasta sandwiches burgers and tacos contribute about 50 percent of total grains intake and snacks and sweets such as chips crackers and cookies about 20 percent breakfast cereals and bars including ready toeat and cooked varieties are the top contributor to wholegrains intake during these life stages despite the underconsumption of whole grains intakes of total grains trend toward overconsumption due to the contribution of refined grains total protein intake generally meets targets except for adolescent females ages 14 through 18 youth typically meet or exceed recommendations for meats poultry and eggs seafood a protein subgroup that can support intakes of beneficial fatty acids is consumed at levels far below the lower end of the recommended intakes range when seafood is consumed it is typically as part of a mixed dish rather than as an individual food item children and adolescents can improve intake patterns by maintaining the components of a healthy diet that are evident in early childhood particularly total fruit and dairy foods

adolescents special considerations the nutrition considerations for the general us population described in chapter 1 apply to children and adolescents for example due to low intakes of food groups as described above the nutrients of public health concerncalcium vitamin d potassium and dietary fiberapply to these life stages as well although the nutritional needs of youth are remarkably similar to their parents guardians and caregivers these age groups do have some special nutrition considerations specifically increasing intakes of sugarsweetened beverages and decreasing intakes of dairy are dietary components with notable and concerning shifts in consumption throughout youth dietary intake patterns for adolescents particularly females also are an area of special consideration accounting for the areas of dietary improvement that are important for all children and adolescents as well as these special considerations can improve diet quality during a time when food preferences and intake patterns are formed when consistently followed these healthy dietary patterns can provide the foundation for healthy dietary patterns in adulthood promote health among youth and help prevent the onset of chronic disease later in life sugarsweetened beverages sugarsweetened beverages eg soda fruit drinks sports and energy drinks are not necessary in the child or adolescent diet nor are they a component of the usda dietary patterns intake of added sugars increases throughout childhood and adolescence and sugarsweetened beverages are a top contributor as a percent of total daily energy intake average intake of added sugars is 11 percent among young children and peaks at 15 percent during adolescence coinciding with this increase is the contribution of sugarsweetened beverages to total intake of added sugars in childhood sugarsweetened beverages make up about 15 to 25 percent of total added sugars intake by adolescence their contribution is 32 percent and even higher when considering coffee and tea beverages with added sugars an additional 7 percent most sugarsweetened beverages eg soda sports drinks do not contribute to meeting food group goals and often contain a high number of calories decreasing consumption of sugarsweetened beverages to reduce added sugars intake will help youth achieve a healthy dietary pattern beverages that contain no added sugars should be the primary choice for children and adolescents these include water and unsweetened fatfree or lowfat milkincluding lowlactose or lactose free options or fortified soy beverageand 100 juice within recommended amounts consuming beverages with no added sugars is particularly important for young children ages 2 through 8 when only a small number of calories remains for other uses after meeting food group and nutrient needs with nutrientdense choices table 31 the number of calories available for other uses increases slightly as energy needs increase throughout adolescence to support growth and development tables 32 and 33 however most adolescents do not consume foods and beverages in their nutrientdense forms meaning they have few or no calories remaining for added sugars ages 218 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 3 children and adolescents page 88 dairy and fortified soy alternatives throughout childhood and adolescence the types of dairy foods consumed and their contribution to a healthy dietary pattern change milk consumption particularly milk as a beverage is lower and cheese intake typically as part of mixed dishes such as sandwiches pizza or pasta is higher among adolescents when compared to younger children these differences in consumption occur alongside the widening gap between current and recommended intakes of dairy foods that occurs throughout youth nutrientdense options within the dairy group are unsweetened fatfree and lowfat 1 milk yogurt cheese fortified soy beverages and yogurt and lowlactose and lactosefree dairy products dairy and fortified soy alternatives provide protein and a variety of nutrients that are underconsumed during these life stages these include three nutrients of public health concern discussed in chapter 1 potassium calcium and vitamin d the nutrient composition of dairy foods highlights the importance of adequate consumption this is especially relevant for calcium and vitamin d given that adolescents have an increased need for consumption to support the accrual of bone mass adolescent nutrition the difference between recommended food group amounts and current intakes is greater for adolescents ages 14 through 18 than for any other age group across the lifespan as a result adolescents are at greater risk of dietary inadequacy than are other age groups for adolescent males and females low intakes of nutrientdense foods and beverages within the grains dairy and alternatives fruits and vegetables food groups lead to low intakes of phosphorus magnesium and choline adolescent females also consume less meat poultry and eggs than do adolescent males and in combination with low consumption of seafood and other protein subgroups including beans peas and lentils this results in the underconsumption of total protein in addition adolescent females have low dietary intakes of iron folate vitamin b6 and vitamin b12 the potential for nutrient deficiencies existing alongside underconsumption of nutrients of public health concern for all americans creates a concerning constellation of nutritional risks at a time of rapid growth and development along with the onset of puberty menarche and hormonal changes juice many juice products such as fruit drinks contain minimal juice content and are considered sugarsweetened beverages because they are primarily composed of water with added sugars the percent of juice in a beverage may be found on the package label such as contains 25 juice or 100 fruit juice the nutrition facts label identifies the amount of sugars in juice products that are not naturally occurring ie added sugars although 100 fruit juice without added sugars can be part of a healthy dietary pattern it is lower in dietary fiber than whole fruit dietary fiber is a dietary component of public health concern with the recognition that fruit should mostly be consumed in whole forms the amount of fruit juice in the usda food patterns ranges from 4 fluid ounces at the lower calorie levels and no more than 10 fluid ounces at the highest calorie levels ages 218 page 89 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 3 children and adolescents supporting healthy eating the physical mental and emotional changes that occur as children transition from preschool to schoolage and into adolescence come with diverse and changing opportunities to support a healthy dietary pattern support and active engagement from the various people and places involved in the lives of children and adolescents is necessary to help establish and maintain healthy dietary patterns that support healthy weight and the prevention of chronic disease in early childhood parents guardians and caregivers have a primary role in supporting healthy eating because they control the foods and beverages purchased prepared and served exposing young children to a variety of nutrientdense foods within each food group helps build a healthy dietary pattern at an age when taste preferences are acquired introducing children to a variety of nutrientdense foods can be challenging as children grow their search for a sense of autonomy and desire for independence often manifest through selective or picky eating food neophobia or food jags eating only one or a few foods for periods of time offering the same type of food to children multiple times in a variety of forms or prepared in different ways can increase acceptance and intake of healthy foods within food groups for example children may show a dislike for vegetables in the cooked form but accept the raw version or children may only accept fruit when it is cut into small bitesized pieces even with these strategies parents guardians and caregivers of young children should know it may take up to 8 to 10 exposures before a child will accept a new food childrens dietary patterns often resemble those of their household highlighting the importance of their environment in the establishment of a healthy dietary pattern shared meals through shopping cooking and consumption provides parents guardians and caregivers with an opportunity to model healthy eating behaviors and dietary practices by making nutrientdense foods and beverages part of the normal household routine children can observe and learn healthy behaviors that can extend throughout later life stages ideally children continue to be exposed to a healthy dietary pattern as they experience changes to their daily routines such as spending time in child care or school settings as at home eating occasions in these settings can be used as opportunities to support a healthy dietary pattern for example snacks can be used as a way to promote intake of nutrientdense fruits and vegetables like carrot sticks and hummus or apple slices instead of foods like chips or cookies using snacks as an opportunity to encourage nutrientdense food group choices is especially relevant during early childhood when the total volume of food consumed at regular meals is lower and snacking is common when exposed to nutrientdense foods and beverages at an early age and supported in making healthy choices across environments a healthy dietary pattern can be established and maintained as children transition to the adolescence life stage with this transition comes increasing autonomy increased influence of peers and decreased influence of parents guardians and caregivers on food choice as a result foods and beverages are more commonly consumed outside of the home often with a preference for convenience foods that often are not nutrientdense parents guardians and caregivers can continue to support healthy eating during this life stage by providing convenient access to nutrientdense foods involving children and adolescents in meal decisions shopping and cooking and guiding adolescents selection of food purchased and consumed outside the home in schools and community settings healthy eating can be encouraged by creating an environment that makes healthy choices the norm ages 218 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 3 children and adolescents page 90 accessing a healthy dietary pattern many resources exist to support healthy growth and development during childhood and adolescence the following government programs play an essential role in providing access to healthy meals and educational resources to support healthy dietary patterns for all children and adolescents the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap provides temporary benefits to families with qualifying incomes for the purchase of foods and beverages about onehalf of all snap participants are children1 households with young children may be eligible for the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic wic can help families with limited resources meet their childs nutritional needs by providing nutritious foods to supplement diets wic serves children up to the age of 5 years who are at nutritional risk in childcare and afterschool settings the child and adult care food program cacfp can support the development of healthy dietary patterns cacfp is a nutrition program that provides reimbursements for meals and snacks that align with the dietary guidelines to eligible children enrolled at childcare centers daycare homes and in afterschool programs schoolage children can benefit from the national school lunch program and school breakfast program the school meal programs can provide nearly twothirds of daily calories and therefore play an influential role in the development of a healthy dietary pattern outside of the school year the summer food service program sfsp fills the gap by ensuring that children continue to receive nutritious meals when school is not in session the sfsp operates at sites in a community where children can receive nutritious meals in a safe and supervised environment professionals working with youth and their families can use these and additional government and nongovernment resources that exist at the community to support healthy eating during these life stages and to establish the foundation for a healthy dietary pattern that will promote health and support disease prevention in later years looking toward chapter 4 adults this chapter focused on nutrition issues relevant to children and adolescents these issues are particularly important because this life stage encompasses significant transitions from young children who are still dependent on parents guardians and caregivers for all their food choices to adolescents who are highly independent in their food choices diet quality tends to decrease as children mature into adolescence with resulting concerns about underconsumption of nutrients of public health concern establishing and maintaining healthy food and beverages choices now can set a firm foundation for healthy dietary patterns that reduce the risk of dietrelated chronic disease an issue of increasing

to healthy eating constraints on available time and financial resources may make it challenging for adults to adopt and maintain a healthy dietary pattern support for healthy food and beverage choices across the multiple places where adults live work play and gather is needed to improve dietary patterns among adults many individuals enter the adult life stage with an unhealthy dietary pattern already established from the childhood and adolescent years a concerted effort to change this trajectory and support adults in adopting a healthy dietary pattern is needed for better health and to promote the wellbeing of family and friends across life stages learned food and beverage preferences and norms and values placed on diet physical activity and health can positively or negatively influence health because they can determine an individuals willingness to change and maintain behaviors these norms and values including preferences toward certain types of food attitudes about healthy eating and beliefs about the importance of physical activity can extend beyond the individual to larger social networks influencing the behaviors of friends and older or younger family members among adults caring for children role modeling healthy dietary choices is important because the food components of public health concern observed in earlier life stages are similar for adults following a healthy dietary pattern engaging in regular physical activity and managing body weight are critical during this life stage more than onehalf of adults are living with one or more chronic diseasediseases that are often related to poorquality diets and physical inactivity improving dietary patterns in adulthood can play a beneficial role in promoting health and preventing the onset or rate of progression of chronic disease for adults with overweight or obesity making healthful changes to dietary patterns and increasing physical activity will improve health and prevent additional weight gain and or promote weight loss see the importance of physical activity and overweight and obesity adults ages 1959 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 4 adults page 94 the importance of physical activity adults who are physically active are healthier feel better and are less likely to develop many chronic diseases than are adults who are inactive for adults regular physical activity can provide both immediate benefits eg boost mood reduce stress improve sleep and longterm benefits eg improved bone health and reduced risk of many diseases such as cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes depression dementia and many types of cancer adults should move more and sit less throughout the day some physical activity is better than none to attain the most health benefits from physical activity adults need at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity like brisk walking or fast dancing each week adults also need musclestrengthening activity like lifting weights or doing pushups at least 2 days each week the us department of health and human services physical activity guidelines for americans and related move your way resources have more information about the benefits of physical activity and tips on how to get started available at healthgovpaguidelines overweight and obesity in the united states 74 percent of adults have overweight or obesity creating an increased risk for the development of other chronic health conditions including cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer losing weight and maintaining weight loss is not a simple task it requires adults to reduce the number of calories they get from foods and beverages and increase the amount expended through physical activity weight loss and maintenance are not likely achieved using shortterm solutions they require a commitment to longterm lifestyle change and often need support from healthcare providers family members and social networks intensive behavioral interventions that use one or more strategieslike group sessions and changes in both diet and physical activitycan be effective for individuals trying to lose a significant amount of weight in addressing obesity professionals should be mindful of health problems stemming from obesityrelated stigma and discrimination the centers for disease control and

dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 4 adults healthy dietary patterns adults are encouraged to follow the recommendations on the types of foods and beverages that make up a healthy dietary pattern described in chapter 1 nutrition and health across the lifespan the guidelines and key recommendations the usda dietary patterns provide a framework of nutrientdense foods and beverages that can be adapted to accommodate budget culture and personal preferences to help adults follow a healthy dietary pattern and meet the guidelines and their key recommendations table 41 displays the healthy usstyle dietary pattern at eight calorie levels that are appropriate for most adults ages 19 through 59 years to illustrate the specific amounts and limits for food groups and other dietary components that make up healthy dietary patterns in general calorie needs are lower for females compared to males calorie needs decline throughout adulthood due to changes in metabolism that accompany aging level of physical activity body composition and the presence of chronic disease are additional factors that affect calorie needs females ages 19 through 30 require about 1800 to 2400 calories a day males in this age group have higher calorie needs of about 2400 to 3000 a day calorie needs for adults ages 31 through 59 are generally lower most females require about 1600 to 2200 calories a day and males require about 2200 to 3000 calories a day additional information on these estimates is provided in table 41 footnote a and in appendix 2 estimated calorie needs the usda

adults figures 41 and 43 show that adults are exceeding recommendations for added sugars saturated fat and sodium about 60 percent of men and 65 percent of women exceed the limit for intakes of added sugars this is an average daily intake of about 330 calories from added sugars for men and around 250 calories for women more than 70 percent of adults are exceeding the recommendations for saturated fat the average daily intakes of saturated fat is about 290 calories for men and 210 calories for women the calorie levels relevant to most adults 16003000 calories have about 100 to 400 calories remaining after food group recommendations are met through nutrient dense choices combined these average amounts of calories from added sugars and saturated fat exceed the amount most adults have available and do not account for calories from alcoholic beverages for sodium nearly all men and about 80 percent of women consume too much on a given day men generally consume more than 4000 mg of

considerations the dietary considerations for the general us population including adults are described in chapter 1 the following sections of this chapter focus on several special considerations to support a healthy dietary pattern for adults that reflect adults current intake patterns and the prevalence of overweight and obesity and dietrelated chronic disease that become more apparent in this life stage these considerations include a focus on dietary changes to increase intakes of dietary fiber calcium and vitamin d and to decrease intakes of added sugars saturated fat and sodium special considerations related to alcoholic beverages also are discussed dietary fiber dietary patterns that do not meet recommended intakes of fruits vegetables and whole grains contribute to low intakes of dietary fiber more than 90 percent of women and 97 percent of men do not meet recommended intakes for dietary fiber this aligns with intake patterns where fruits vegetables and whole grains are underconsumed by more than 85 percent of adults appendix 1 nutritional goals for agesex groups provides dietary fiber goals for men and women based on the dietary reference intakes these recommendations are based on levels observed to reduce risk of coronary heart disease increasing intakes of fruits vegetables and replacing refined grains with whole grains to improve dietary fiber intakes is especially important during this life stage as the impact of poor diet quality becomes apparent with the onset andor progression of dietrelated chronic diseases chapter 1 provides strategies on how to increase intakes of these important food groups a list of common food sources of dietary fiber is available at dietaryguidelinesgov calcium and vitamin d calcium and vitamin d are important at any age and most adults do not consume adequate amounts close to 30 percent of men and 60 percent of women older than age 19 years do not consume enough calcium and more than 90 percent do not consume enough vitamin d dietary patterns that do not meet recommended intake amounts for food groups and subgroups which include sources of calcium and vitamin dsuch as dairy foods and fortified soy alternatives and seafoodcontribute to low intake of these nutrients particular attention should be given to consuming adequate amounts of foods with these nutrients during adult years to promote optimal bone health and prevent the onset of osteoporosis adequate intake of calcium and vitamin d is particularly important for adults during the time period when peak bone mass is still actively accruing ages 19 through about 30 and for women in the postmenopausal period when rapid bone remodeling occurs a healthy dietary pattern with nutrientdense calciumrich foods such as lowfat milk and yogurt and fortified soy alternatives and canned sardines and salmon can help adults better meet intake recommendations vitamin d aids in the absorption of calcium consuming the recommended amount of seafood and choosing foods that are fortified with vitamin d including milk fortified soy beverages and fortified soy yogurt and some wholegrain cereals can help adults meet their needs in addition to dietary sources the body can make vitamin d from the adults ages 1959 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 4 adults page 102 sun however some individuals may have difficulty producing sufficient vitamin d from sunlight exposure or consuming enough vitamin d from foods and beverages so a supplement may be recommended by a health professional appendix 1 provides calcium and vitamin d goals for men and women based on the dietary reference intakes a list of common food sources of calcium and vitamin d is available at dietaryguidelinesgov saturated fat chapter 1 explains the importance of limiting intakes of saturated fat to support healthy dietary patterns staying within saturated fat limits and replacing saturated fat with unsaturated fat is of particular importance during the adult life stage the prevalence of coronary heart disease increases with age and high ldl cholesterol peaks between the ages of 50 to 59 in men and 60 to 69 in women about 70 to 75 percent of adults exceed the 10percent limit on saturated fat as a result of selecting foods and beverages across food groups that are not in nutrient dense forms the top sources of saturated fat for adults are sandwiches eg deli sandwiches burgers tacos burritos grilled cheese hot dogs and other grainbased mixed dishes eg spaghetti and meatballs casseroles quesadillas that typically contain ingredients from several food groups that are not in nutrientdense forms including grains protein foods and dairy making changes to the type of ingredients as well as amount andor frequency of their consumption will help adults lower saturated fat intake without a need to eliminate these foods from the household diet strategies include using lean meats and lowfat cheese to prepare these foods or substituting beans in place of meats as the protein source saturated fat also can be reduced by substituting certain ingredients with sources of unsaturated fat eg using avocado nuts or seeds in a dish instead of cheese cooking with oils higher in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat eg canola corn olive peanut safflower soybean and sunflower instead of butter also can reduce intakes of saturated fat sodium the number of adults exceeding the chronic disease risk reduction level for sodium see chapter 1 or appendix 1 during this life stage is concerning given that 45 percent of adults ages 18 and older are living with hypertension during adulthood prevalence of hypertension increases from about 22 percent of adults ages 18 through 39 to about 55 percent of adults ages 40 through 591 changing this trend is important because hypertension is a preventable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and stroke unlike other factors that cannot be changed such as genetics and family history reduced dietary intake of sodium is a modifiable risk factor that can help improve blood pressure control and reduce risk of hypertension overconsumption of sodium occurs for several reasons as discussed in chapter 1 because sodium is found in foods and beverages across all food groups with most coming from foods that have salt added during commercial processing rather than salt added to foods during or after preparation reducing sodium consumption will require a joint effort by individuals the food and beverage industry and food service and retail establishments 1 ostchega y fryar cd nwankwo t

dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 4 adults added sugars most adults exceed recommended limits for added sugars as a result of eating foods and drinking beverages higher in added sugars and selecting foods and beverages across food groups that are not in nutrientdense forms added sugars are of particular concern for adults because exceeding limits contributes to excess calorie intake beverages as a source of added sugars sugarsweetened beverages eg soda sports drinks energy drinks fruit drinks and sweetened coffees and teas including readytodrink varieties contribute over 40 percent of daily intake of added sugars more than in earlier life stages adults consume coffees and teas with additions such as sugar and flavored syrup frequent consumption of these and other beverages containing added sugars can contribute to excess calorie intake some sugarsweetened beverages such as coffee and tea with milk contribute to food group intake eg dairy and can be made without added sugars others such as fruit drinks can be replaced with nutrientdense options such as 100 juice to help meet fruit group recommendations most adults diets include choices across multiple food groups that are not in nutrientdense forms and therefore cannot accommodate excess calories from sweetened beverages intake of sugarsweetened beverages should be limited to small amounts and most often replaced with beverage options that contain no added sugars such as water other sources of added sugars a variety of foods and beverages contribute to the remaining added sugars consumed by adults in addition to the contribution of sugarsweetened beverages and sweetened coffees and teas about 30 percent come from desserts and sweet snacks candies and sweetened breakfast cereals the remaining 30 percent of added sugars is consumed in relatively small amounts across many food categories as discussed in chapter 1 many of these food categories have seen market expansion in recent years for example over the past decade beverages snacks and bakery foods have continuously topped the list for the most new product introductions2 as these and other food categories continue to change and expand it is vital for individuals to learn how to identify the amount of added sugars in a beverage or food product by reading the nutrition facts label see chapter 1 understanding which food choices contribute to intakes of added sugars without contributing to nutrient needs can help individuals remove or replace these foods with better choices that meet food group and nutrient recommendations within calorie needs 2 additional information is available at ersusdagovtopicsfoodmarketspricesprocessingmarketingnewproductsaspx adults ages 1959 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 4 adults page 104 alcoholic beverages alcoholic beverages are not a component of the usda dietary patterns and their calories are considered discretionary regular consumption of alcoholic beverages can make it challenging for adults to meet food group and nutrient needs while not consuming excess calories the ingredients in certain mixed drinks including soda mixers and heavy cream also can contribute to intake of added sugars and saturated fat the majority of us adults consume alcoholic beverages about 66 percent of adults ages 21 through 59 report alcoholic beverage consumption in the past month and of those approximately half report binge drinking sometimes multiple times per month among adults who choose to drink average intakes of calories from alcoholic beverages exceed the remaining calorie limit that is available after food group recommendations are met there are some adults who should not drink alcoholic beverages at all such as if they are pregnant or might be pregnant younger than age 21 or recovering from an alcohol use disorder or if they are unable to control the amount they drink for those who choose to drink intakes should be limited to 1 drink or less in a day for women and 2 drinks or less in a day for men on days when alcohol is consumed more information in available in chapter 1 under alcoholic beverages supporting healthy eating individuals need support in making healthy choices at home work and in the community to build healthy dietary patterns food retail outlets eg grocery stores convenience stores restaurants provide adults with the option to purchase ingredients to prepare foods themselves or to purchase foods prepared by others national food expenditures suggest the purchase of prepared foods is a regular habit for most adults with expenditures outpacing those of foods purchased for household meal preparation3 estimates also suggest that the younger generation of american adults are spending an even larger proportion of their total food dollars on prepared foods than are older generations4 when adults prepare meals themselves they have more control over the types of food ingredients selected and can focus on choosing nutrientdense options that contribute to food group goals with little or no added sugars and saturated fat and less sodium the same is not always true when purchasing prepared foods despite changes and innovation in the marketplace such as menu and product labeling or reformulation for some adults preparing and consuming healthy meals at home will mean adopting a new habit andor learning new skills such as meal planning for others it may entail small changes to current routines planning meals and snacks in advance with food groups and nutrientdense foods and beverages in mind can support healthy eating at home and improve dietary patterns of individuals and families preparing meals with family and friends also presents an opportunity for greater connection and enjoyment around food for adults who are parents guardians or caregivers of children or adolescents preparing meals also provides an opportunity to teach valuable cooking skills and model behaviors that support the adoption of healthy dietary patterns across younger life stages 3 details are available at ersusdagovwebdocspublications96957ap083pdfv58483

dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 4 adults it is not realistic or desirable to avoid the purchase and consumption of foods prepared by others limits on available time and the desire for convenience make restaurant and readytoeat meals a part of many household routines many of these settings also provide for social enjoyment of food with friends and family however foods prepared outside of the home can contribute to the overconsumption of calories as a result of large portion sizes and methods of preparation being mindful of the portion sizes and ingredients of prepared foods can help adults achieve a healthy dietary pattern while still enjoying foods prepared by others health promotion activities that center on increasing consumer knowledge and access to healthy options in the places where americans purchase prepared foods are needed to provide support for adults in these efforts health professionals play an important role in supporting adults healthy eating behaviors helping adults become more aware of the foods and beverages that make up their typical dietary patterns and identifying areas for improvement can empower individuals to make changes to the types of foods they purchase or prepare teaching skills like cooking and meal planning and helping adults understand how to read labels or make healthy menu substitutions also will support the adoption of a healthy dietary pattern during this life stage in settings where adults spend their time changing organizational practices approaches andor policies to support improved dietary patterns also is needed strategies include offering healthy meals and snacks in workplace cafeterias and vending machines or implementing educational programs tailored to working adults or communities can support farmers markets community gardens and related educational programming efforts accessing a healthy dietary pattern a healthy dietary pattern can only be achieved when adequate resources and supports exist in the places where adults live work and gather food access is crucial for adults to achieve a healthy dietary pattern and is influenced by diverse factors as discussed in chapter 1 food insecurity which occurs when access to nutritionally adequate and safe food is limited or uncertain is most prevalent in households with children and in singleparent households income is one of the primary characteristics associated with food insecurity government programs such as the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap or the food distribution program on indian reservations fdpir serve as a resource for lowincome adults by supplementing food budgets to support healthy lifestyles adults with children or those caring for older family members also may benefit from resources discussed in chapters 2 3 and 6 additional government and nongovernment resources such as food banks or community meal sites and programming offered through snap education snaped and the expanded food and nutrition education program efnep play a role in providing food and educational resources to support adults in making healthy food choices within a limited budget innovative approaches to support health such as incentive programs at farmers markets or healthy cornerstore initiatives continue to expand continued attention and creativity in approaches to expand food access are needed to support a healthy dietary pattern for adults and the larger social networks that they influence learn more the federal foodservice guidelines is a resource that food service providers can use to help make

20202025 chapter 4 adults page 106 looking toward chapter 5 women who are pregnant or lactating and chapter 6 older adults this chapter has discussed the importance of a healthy dietary pattern and related special considerations during the adult life stage the chapter recognizes that dietary patterns are generally well established by the time individuals reach adulthood and encourages adults to take advantage of the many opportunities available to make changes that support a healthy dietary pattern making these changes can have important benefits for achieving a healthy weight status reducing chronic disease risk and promoting overall health these considerations are especially important for the life stages discussed in the next two chapters chapter 5 takes a closer look at a special time in the life of many adultspregnancy and lactation this chapter echoes the same guidance for adults on following a healthy dietary pattern and discusses several special considerations that arise during this life stage chapter 6 then makes the transition from the adults chapter to a focused look at healthy eating for older adults women who are pregnant or lactating women who are pregnant

special stages of life for women and nutrition plays a vital role before during and after these life stages to support the health of the mother and her child following a healthy dietary pattern is especially important for those who are pregnant or lactating for several reasons increased calorie and nutrient intakes are necessary to support the growth and development of the baby and to maintain the mothers health consuming a healthy dietary pattern before and during pregnancy also may improve pregnancy outcomes in addition following a healthy dietary pattern before and during pregnancy and lactation has the potential to affect health outcomes for both the mother and child in subsequent life stages this chapter addresses some important nutritional considerations for women before pregnancy and contains nutrition guidance for women during pregnancy and lactation a healthy dietary pattern along with changing calorie and nutrient needs during pregnancy and lactation are described throughout the chapter special consideration is given to the importance of achieving and maintaining a healthy weight before pregnancy gaining weight within gestational weight gain guidelines and returning to a healthy weight during the postpartum period a healthy weight status during these life stages has short and longterm health benefits for the mother and her child the chapter also discusses other considerations important to pregnancy and lactation including those related to intake of seafood alcohol and caffeinated beverages finally during pregnancy nausea vomiting food aversions and food cravings can make it difficult for some women to achieve optimal dietary intake the chapter discusses how these can be considered when helping women who are pregnant or lactating make healthy food and beverage choices women who are pregnant or lactating dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 5 women who are pregnant or lactating page 110 healthy dietary patterns women who are pregnant or lactating are encouraged to follow the recommendations on the types of foods and beverages that make up a healthy dietary pattern described in chapter 1 nutrition and health

pregnant table 51 shows the healthy usstyle dietary pattern to illustrate the specific amounts and limits for food groups and other dietary components that make up healthy dietary patterns at the six calorie levels most relevant to women who are pregnant or lactating following a healthy dietary pattern during these life stages can help women meet the guidelines and its key recommendations the usda dietary patterns are discussed in greater detail in chapter 1 and appendix 3 usda dietary patterns table 52 summarizes estimated daily calorie needs during pregnancy and lactation compared to prepregnancy needs for women with a healthy prepregnancy weight additional information on estimates of prepregnancy calorie needs is provided in table 51 footnote a and in appendix 2 estimated calorie needs as shown in table 52 calorie needs generally increase as pregnancy progresses and remain elevated during lactation however it is important to note that women with a prepregnancy weight that is considered overweight or obese have lower weight gain recommendations than do women with a healthy prepregnancy weight see weight management women should follow their healthcare providers guidance regarding appropriate caloric intake during pregnancy and lactation as many factors including prepregnancy weight status gestational weight gain and multiple pregnancies may affect calorie needs in general it is important for women who are pregnant to be under the care of a healthcare provider who can monitor their health status and the progress of their pregnancy the increased calorie and nutrient needs for these life stages should be met by consuming nutrientdense food choices as part of a healthy dietary pattern one way to achieve this is to follow the healthy usstyle dietary pattern throughout pregnancy and lactation but adjust intake of food groups to reflect higher calorie patterns recommended during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and throughout lactation in short women should meet their increased calorie and nutrient needs with nutrientdense foods instead of with foods high in added sugars saturated fat and sodium the customizable components of the usda dietary patterns provide flexibility that allows womenor professionals adapting these patternsto choose from a variety of foods and beverages within each food group to suit individual preference lifestyle traditions culture and budget this flexibility in being able to select among a variety of nutrientdense options is particularly important for women who experience pregnancyinduced nausea vomiting or food aversions when making food and beverage choices women should know that unless its medically indicated to avoid for her own health women do not need to restrict their choices during pregnancy or lactation to prevent food allergy from developing in their child however women who are pregnant should pay attention to some important food safety considerations see food safety during pregnancy nutrientdense foods and beverages nutrientdense foods and beverages provide vitamins minerals and other healthpromoting components and have little added sugars saturated fat and sodium

retain 20 pounds or more at 12 months postpartum postpartum weight retention results in about 1 in 7 women moving from a healthy weight classification before pregnancy to an overweight classification postpartum current estimates show that about half of women of childbearing age have a weight classification of overweight or obese women with overweight or obesity frequently exceed gestational weight

public health concerncalcium vitamin d potassium and dietary fiberapply to these life stages as well in addition iron is a nutrient of public health concern for women who are pregnant these life stages also have some special nutrient and dietary considerations regarding folate iodine choline seafood alcoholic beverages and caffeinated beverages that are discussed in the following sections of this chapter meeting nutrient needs as discussed in chapter 1 nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods and beverages however this may be difficult for some women especially those who are pregnant most healthcare providers recommend women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant take a daily prenatal vitamin and mineral supplement in addition to consuming a healthy dietary pattern this may be especially important to meet folatefolic acid iron iodine and vitamin d needs during pregnancy see appendix 1 nutritional goals for agesex groups nutrient needs for women who are lactating differ from those who are pregnant continued use of prenatal supplements by women who are lactating may exceed their needs for folic acid and iron women who are lactating should not exceed the tolerable upper intake level ul of 1000 micrograms of folic acid and 45 milligrams of iron women should seek guidance from a healthcare provider on appropriate use of prenatal or other dietary supplements during lactation folatefolic acid the rda for folate is higher during pregnancy and lactation than all other life stages see appendix 1 adequate folic acid intake is particularly important prior to conception and during the first trimester to help prevent neural tube defects the united states preventative services task force uspstf recommends that all women who are planning or capable of pregnancy take a daily supplement containing 400 to 800 mcg of folic acid the critical period for supplementation starts at least 1 month before conception and continues through the first 2 to 3 months of pregnancy dietary supplements may contain either folic acid or 5methyltetrahydrofolate 5mthf but only folic acid has been shown to prevent neural tube defects most prenatal supplements sold in the united states contain folic acid the recommendation for folic acid supplementation is in addition to the amounts of food folate contained in a healthy eating pattern folate is found inherently in darkgreen vegetables and beans peas and lentils all enriched grains ie bread pasta rice and cereal and some corn masa flours are fortified with folic acid iron iron needs increase during pregnancy compared to prepregnancy for women who are lactating before menstruation returns iron needs fall and then return to prepregnancy levels once menstruation resumes see appendix 1 iron is a key nutrient during pregnancy that supports fetal development iron deficiency affects about 1 in 10 women who are pregnant and 1 in 4 women during their third trimester heme iron which is found in animal source foods eg lean meats poultry and some seafood is more readily absorbed by the body than the nonheme iron found in plant source foods eg beans peas lentils and darkgreen vegetables additional iron sources include foods enriched or fortified with iron such as many wholewheat breads and readytoeat women who are pregnant or lactating dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 5 women who are pregnant or lactating page 116 cereals absorption of iron from nonheme sources is enhanced by consuming them along with vitamin crich foods food source lists for both heme and nonheme iron are available at dietaryguidelinesgov women who are pregnant or who are planning to become pregnant are advised to take a supplement containing iron when recommended by an obstetrician or other healthcare provider more than half of women continue to use prenatal supplements during lactation most prenatal supplements are designed to meet the higher iron needs of pregnancy depending on various factorssuch as when menstruation returnsprenatal supplements may exceed the iron needs of women who are lactating women should seek guidance from a healthcare provider regarding the appropriate level of iron supplementation during lactation based on their unique needs iodine iodine needs increase substantially during pregnancy and lactation see appendix 1 adequate iodine intake during pregnancy is important for neurocognitive development of the fetus although women of reproductive age generally have adequate iodine intake some women particularly those who do not regularly consume dairy products eggs seafood or use iodized table salt may not consume enough iodine to meet increased needs during pregnancy and lactation women who are pregnant or lactating should not be encouraged to start using table salt if they do not do so already however they should ensure that any table salt used in cooking or added to food at the table is iodized additionally women who are pregnant or lactating may need a supplement containing iodine in order to achieve adequate intake many prenatal supplements do not contain iodine thus it is important to read the label vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns during pregnancy and lactation women following a vegetarian or vegan dietary pattern during these life stages may need to take special care to ensure nutrient adequacy iron may be of particular concern because plant source foods only contain nonheme iron which is less bioavailable than heme iron food source lists for both heme and nonheme iron are available at dietaryguidelinesgov vitamin b12 also is of concern because it is present only in animal source foods women following a vegetarian or vegan dietary pattern should consult with a healthcare provider to determine whether supplementation of iron vitamin b12 andor other nutrients such as choline zinc iodine or epadha is necessary and if so the appropriate levels to meet their unique needs women who are pregnant or lactating page 117 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 5 women who are pregnant or lactating choline choline needs also increase during pregnancy and lactation see appendix 1 adequate intake of choline during these life stages helps to both replenish maternal stores and support the growth and development of the childs brain and spinal cord most women do not meet recommended intakes of choline during pregnancy and lactation women are encouraged to consume a variety of cholinecontaining foods during these life stages choline can be found throughout many food groups and subgroups meeting recommended intakes for the dairy and protein food groupswith eggs meats and some seafood being notable sourcesas well as the beans peas and lentils subgroup can help meet choline needs meeting nutrient needs through foods and beverages is preferred but women who are concerned about meeting recommendations should speak with their healthcare provider to determine whether choline supplementation is appropriate many prenatal supplements do not contain choline or only contain small amounts inadequate to meet recommendations seafood seafood intake during pregnancy is recommended as it is associated with favorable measures of cognitive development in young children women who are pregnant or lactating should consume at least 8 and up to 12 ounces of a variety of seafood per week from choices lower in methylmercury the us food and drug administration fda and the us environmental protection agency epa provide joint advice regarding seafood consumption to limit methylmercury exposure for women who might become or who are pregnant or lactating methylmercury can be harmful to the brain and nervous system if a person is exposed to too much of it over time this is particularly important during pregnancy because eating too much of it can have negative effects on the developing fetus based on fda and epas advice depending on body weight some women should choose seafood lowest in methylmercury or eat less seafood than the amounts in the healthy usstyle dietary pattern additionally certain species of seafood eg shark swordfish king mackerel should be avoided during pregnancy more information is available on the fda or epa websites at fdagovfishadvice and epagovfishadvice alcoholic beverages women who are or who may be pregnant should not drink alcohol however consumption of alcohol during pregnancy continues to be of concern in the united states among women who are pregnant about 1 in 10 reported consuming alcohol during the past month with an average intake of 2 or more drink equivalents on days alcohol is consumed it is not safe for women to drink any type or amount of alcohol during pregnancy women who drink alcohol and become pregnant should stop drinking immediately and women who are trying to become pregnant should women who are pregnant or lactating dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 5 women who are pregnant or lactating page 118 not drink at all alcohol can harm the baby at any time during pregnancy even during the first or second month when a woman may not know she is pregnant not drinking alcohol also is the safest option for women who are lactating generally moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages by a woman who is lactating up to 1 standard drink in a day is not known to be harmful to the infant especially if the woman waits at least 2 hours after a single drink before nursing or expressing breast milk additional information on breastfeeding and alcohol can be found at cdcgovbreastfeeding breastfeedingspecialcircumstancesvaccinationsmedicationsdrugs alcoholhtml women considering consuming alcohol during lactation should talk to their healthcare provider caffeine many women consume caffeine during pregnancy or lactation as discussed in chapter 1 most intake of caffeine in the united states comes from coffee tea and soda caffeinated beverages vary widely in their caffeine content caffeine passes from the mother to infant in small amounts through breast milk but usually does not adversely affect the infant when the mother consumes low to moderate amounts about 300 milligrams or less per day which is about 2 to 3 cups of coffee more information is available at cdcgovbreastfeedingbreastfeedingspecialcircumstancesdiet andmicronutrientsmaternaldiethtml women who could be or who are pregnant should consult their healthcare providers for advice concerning caffeine consumption food safety during pregnancy women who are pregnant and their unborn children are more susceptible than are the general population to the effects of foodborne illnesses such as listeriosis they need to take special care to keep foods safe and to not eat foods that increase the risk of foodborne illness during pregnancy women should only eat foods containing seafood meats poultry or eggs that have been cooked to recommended safe minimum internal temperatures they also should take special precautions not to consume unpasteurized raw juice or milk raw sprouts or some soft cheeses made from unpasteurized milk deli and luncheon meats and hot dogs should be

the mother and the baby physical activity increases or maintains cardiorespiratory fitness and reduces the risk of excessive weight gain and gestational diabetes for many benefits healthy women without contraindications should do a least 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity a week as they are able women who habitually did vigorousintensity activity or a lot of aerobic or musclestrengthening physical activity before pregnancy can continue to do so during pregnancy women can consult their healthcare provider about whether or how to adjust their physical activity during pregnancy postpartum physical activity following the birth of a child continues to benefit a womans overall health physical activity during the postpartum period increases cardiorespiratory fitness improves mood and reduces the symptoms of postpartum depression additionally physical activity can help achieve and maintain a healthy weight and when combined with caloric restriction helps promote

increased interest in and motivation to make healthy lifestyle changes during pregnancy and lactation furthermore the dietary choices made during these life stages can affect womens health and the health of their children supporting women in adopting healthy dietary patterns during this important time of life and sustaining them thereafter also enables them to serve as role models when their children begin transitioning to complementary foods women who are pregnant or lactating face many real or perceived barriers when trying to meet the recommendations of the dietary guidelines constraints on time and financial resources limited access to high quality childcare and family leave policies as well as inadequate breastfeeding support at home or at work are barriers women may face these barriers should be considered by all those who support women in their efforts to follow a healthy dietary pattern ensuring women have access to healthy safe food is vital due to the critical role nutrition plays in health promotion during these life stages this is particularly critical for families dealing with food insecurity which is most prevalent in households with children and in singleparent households participation in federal programs such as the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic which serves lowincome pregnant breastfeeding and nonbreastfeeding postpartum women and infants and children up to age 5 can help alleviate these challenges and improve dietary intake for many women and children facing economic hardship the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap and the food distribution program on indian reservations fdpir can also serve as resources for lowincome women and their families by both supplementing food budgets to support health and by providing nutrition education through the snaped program additionally usdas healthy eating on a budget1 can help women and families plan and prepare healthy inexpensive meals other government and nongovernment resources such as food banks or community meal programs also provide food and educational resources that can support women in making healthy food choices for themselves and their families support during lactation can help women meet their breastfeeding goals despite significant demands on their time and energy during this life stage worksite programs and policies that allow women adequate time to pump breast milk when away from their child as well as access to good quality childcare can allow women who return to work to achieve breastfeeding goals access to breastfeeding peer counselors such as those used in wic or free breastfeeding support groups through local hospitals also can support women during this life stage additionally health professionals can promote the usdas wic breastfeeding support2 and the us department of health and human services office of womens health owh your guide to breastfeeding3 and their

number of health and social changes that affect this populations nutritional status compared to younger adults older adults are at greater risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer as well as health conditions related to changes in bone and muscle mass such as osteoporosis and sarcopenia respectively an increasing number of older adults start this life stage with excess body weight preventing additional weight gain and achieving a healthy weight by following a healthy dietary pattern and adopting an active lifestyle can support healthy aging selecting healthy food and beverage choices is important for people throughout this life stage regardless of their race or ethnicity or their current health status it is never too late to make improvements older adults should follow a healthy dietary pattern because of the changing dietary needs and the heightened risk of malnutrition that occurs with age older adults generally have lower calorie needs but similar or even increased nutrient needs compared to younger adults the overall nutrient density of dietary patterns is particularly important to this age group lower calorie needs result from less physical activity changes in metabolism andor agerelated loss in bone and muscle mass other factors may affect nutrient needs and absorption of nutrients in older adults including chronic disease and conditions use of multiple medications and changes in body composition the healthy dietary patterns described below take the unique needs of older adults into account and are further supported by

appendix 3 adults ages 60 and older dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 6 older adults page 128 special considerations the nutrition considerations for the general us population described in chapter 1 apply to older adults for example the nutrients of public concern calcium vitamin d potassium and dietary fiberapply to this age group as well however this age group also has some special nutrition considerations that are discussed in the following sections of this chapter for example several additional nutrients are more likely to be underconsumed during this life stage these include dietary protein and vitamin b12 beverage intake particularly as it relates to hydration status also is an area of special consideration protein consuming enough protein is important to prevent the loss of lean muscle mass that occurs naturally with age monitoring protein intake is especially important as older adults transition through this life stage intake patterns show average intakes of protein foods is lower for individuals ages 71 and older compared to adults ages 60 through 70 about 50 percent of women and 30 percent of men 71 and older fall short of protein foods recommendations the majority of protein in the healthy usstyle dietary pattern is accounted for in the protein foods subgroups seafood meats poultry and eggs nuts seeds and soy products and the vegetable subgroup of beans peas and lentils which also is considered a protein foods subgroup the dairy and fortified soy alternatives food group is another source of dietary protein most older adults are meeting or exceeding weekly recommendations for meats poultry and eggs making this subgroup a common source of protein foods for older adults table 61 however seafood dairy and fortified soy alternatives and beans peas and lentils are underconsumed yet provide important nutrients that support healthy dietary patterns for example the dairy food group provides calcium vitamin d and vitamin b12 and the beans peas and lentils subgroup provides dietary fiber many choices within the seafood subgroup also provide vitamins d and b12 and calcium if eaten with bones and beneficial fatty acids food sources of calcium vitamin d and dietary fiber are available at dietaryguidelinesgov many older adults can improve their dietary pattern and better meet nutrient needs by choosing from a wider variety of protein sources in some cases this may mean using seafood more often in place of meats poultry or eggs or using beans peas and lentils in mixed dishes such as soups rice or pasta dishes for others it may mean maintaining current intakes of protein and finding enjoyable ways to add protein foods from underconsumed food groups and subgroups in order to ensure that overall protein needs are met vitamin b12 vitamin b12 is of concern for some older adults because the ability to absorb this nutrient can decrease with age and use of certain medications can decrease absorption older adults are encouraged to meet the recommendations for protein foods a common source of vitamin b12 and include foods fortified with vitamin b12 such as breakfast cereals some individuals also may require vitamin b12 dietary supplements individuals are encouraged to speak with their healthcare provider to determine what if any supplementation is appropriate dietary supplements many adults in the united states take one or more dietary supplements either as a pill or drink popular supplements include some nutrients that are underconsumed among older adults including calcium and vitamins d and b12 all sources of a nutrient or food componentwhether from food or a dietary supplementshould be considered when assessing an individuals dietary pattern including any added sugars that may come from supplement drinks older adults should track and discuss all dietary supplement use with their healthcare provider beverage supplements should not replace regular food intake unless instructed by a health professional the national institutes of health office of dietary supplements provides the my dietary supplement and medicine record1 to help individuals track supplement and medicine use 1 available at odsodnihgovpubsdietarysupplementandmedicinerecordpdf adults ages 60 and older page 129 dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 6 older adults beverages many older adults do not drink enough fluids to stay hydrated one reason for this is that the sensation of thirst tends to decline with age concerns about bladder control or issues with mobility also may hinder intake of fluids among older adults mean intakes of beverages show adults ages 60 and older consume significantly fewer fluid ounces across all beverage types compared to adults ages 59 and underabout 2 fewer cups per day most of which is due to drinking less water it is important that older adults drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration and aid in the digestion of food and absorption of nutrients in addition to water choosing unsweetened beverages such as 100 fruit or vegetable juice and lowfat or fatfree milk or fortified soy beverage can support fluid intake to prevent dehydration while helping to achieve food group recommendations the water that is contained in foods such as fruits vegetables and soups contributes to hydration status and is a contributor to total fluid intake alcoholic beverages the dietary guidelines do not recommend initiating alcohol consumption for any reason to help older adults move toward a healthy dietary pattern and minimize risks associated with drinking older adults can choose not to drink or drink in moderationlimiting intakes to 2 drinks or less in a day for men and 1 drink or less in a day for women when alcohol is consumed older adults who choose to drink may experience the effects of alcohol more quickly than they did when they were younger this puts older adults at higher risk of falls car crashes and other injuries that may result from drinking in addition older adults tend to have a greater number of comorbid health conditions than younger adults and alcohol use or misuse may adversely affect the condition or interfere with management of the disease certain older adults should avoid drinking alcohol completely including those who plan to drive or operate machinery or participate in activities that require skill coordination and alertness take certain overthecounter or prescription medications have certain medical conditions are recovering from alcohol use disorder or are unable to control the amount they drink more information on alcoholic beverages and their relationship to health is provided in chapter 1 supporting healthy eating similar to other life stages older adults can be supported by professionals family and friends to achieve a healthy dietary pattern that accounts for factors such as cost preferences traditions and access additional factors to consider when supporting healthy eating for older adults include enjoyment of food sharing meals with friends and family can help increase food enjoyment and promote adequacy of dietary intake for older adults ability to chew or swallow foods experimenting with the preparation of foods from all food groups can help identify textures that are acceptable appealing and enjoyable for adults who have difficulties chewing or swallowing good dental health is critical to overall health as well as the ability to chew foods properly food safety practicing safe food handling procedures is of particular importance for older adults due to a decline in immune system function that accompanies age and that increases the risk of foodborne illness for more information foodsafety gov for older adults foodsafetygovpeopleat riskolderadults or fda fdagovmedia83744 download older adults have access to a variety of government resources to support a healthy dietary pattern as part of overall healthy

and older dietary guidelines for americans 20202025 chapter 6 older adults page 130 physical activity and older adults the benefits of regular physical activity occur throughout life and are essential for healthy aging it is never too late to start being physically active for older adults regular physical activity supports a number of additional health benefits including improved cognition balance and bone strength these benefits make it easier to perform activities of daily living preserves function and mobility and lowers the risk of falls and injuries from falls adults should move more and sit less throughout the day some physical activity is better than none to attain the most health benefits from physical activity older adults need at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderateintensity aerobic activity per week the talk test is a good way to assess moderate intensity for older adults a person doing moderateintensity aerobic activity can talk but not sing older adults also need musclestrengthening activity at least 2 days each week older adults should incorporate multicomponent physical activity that includes balance training as well as aerobic and musclestrengthening activities the us department of health and human services physical activity guidelines for americans and the related move your way resources have information about the benefits of physical activity and tips to get started available at healthgovpaguidelines commodity supplemental food program csfp the csfp supplements the diets of lowincome older adults by providing nutritious usda packaged food to support a healthy dietary pattern the csfp is federally funded and private and nonprofit institutions facilitate the distribution of monthly csfp packages to eligible older adults homedelivered nutrition services the older americans act authorizes meals and related services in a persons home for individuals ages 60 and older and their spouse of any age older adults who experience difficulty leaving the home due to frailty health concerns or certain medical conditions may benefit from homedelivered meals offered under the older americans act child and adult care food program cacfp the cacfp is a federal program that provides reimbursements for nutritious meals and snacks to older adults enrolled in daycare facilities older adults receiving care at nonresidential care centers may receive meals and snacks that meet nutrition standards of the cacfp additional resources to support older adults exist at the community level for example the senior farmers market nutrition program sfmnp provides many lowincome seniors with access to fruits and vegetables grown in their local communities snap education snaped programming may also be offered and teach older adults cooking and shopping skills individuals working within these settings must ensure the availability of nutrientdense foods and assist older adults in choosing a healthy dietary pattern that fits in their cultural and food preferences healthy eating through the lifespan this chapter has focused on the unique nutritional considerations of the older adult life stage it also has reinforced the idea that the core elements of a healthy dietary pattern are remarkably consistent across the lifespan and across health outcomes more than that a healthy dietary pattern is flexiblepeople can customize the dietary guidelines recommendations to suit their personal preferences cultural traditions and budget considerations beginning at the earliest life stageinfancy and toddlerhooda healthy dietary pattern can help people achieve and maintain good health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases however it is never too late to make improvements people at any stage of life can benefit by changing to

2002 the total number of calories a person needs each day varies depending on the persons age sex height weight and level of physical activity in addition a need to lose maintain or gain weight and other factors affect how many calories should be consumed estimated amounts of calories needed to maintain energy balance for various age and sex groups at three different levels of physical activity are provided in table a21 for toddlers ages 12 through 23 months and table a22 for ages 2 and older these estimates are based on the estimated energy requirements eer equations using reference heights average and reference weights healthy for each agesex group for toddlers children and adolescents reference height and weight vary by age for adults the reference man is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 154 pounds the reference woman is 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighs 126 pounds estimates range from 700 to 1000 calories for toddlers ages 12 through 23 months estimated needs for young children ages 2 through 8 range from 1000 to 2000 calories a wider range of 1400 to 3200 calories is estimated for older children and adolescents with males generally having higher calorie needs than females adult estimated calorie needs range from 1600 to 2400 calories per day for females and 2000 to 3000 calories per day for males as shown males generally require more calories than females due to reductions in basal metabolic rate that occur with aging calorie needs generally decrease for adults as they age estimated calorie needs during the first trimester of pregnancy generally do not increase compared to prepregnancy needs additional calories needed for the later trimesters of pregnancy and during lactation are outlined in table a23 and include approximately 300 to 400 additional calories it is recommended that women follow their healthcare providers guidance regarding appropriate caloric intake during pregnancy as many factors including prepregnancy weight status gestational weight gain and multiple pregnancies may affect calorie needs women with overweight or obesity have lower recommended gestational weight gain during pregnancy which may affect calorie needs these

a34 and the healthy mediterraneanstyle dietary pattern table a35 are variations that also exemplify a healthy dietary pattern for the first time the healthy usstyle and healthy vegetarian dietary patterns are provided for toddlers ages 12 through 23 months who are no longer receiving human milk or infant formula these patterns are designed to meet nutrient needs while not exceeding calorie requirements and while staying within limits for overconsumed dietary components such as added sugars saturated fat and sodium the methodology used to develop and update these patterns builds on the rich history usda has in developing food guides this methodology includes using current food consumption data to determine the mix and proportions of foods to include in each group food composition data is used to select a nutrientdense representative for each food and calculate nutrient profiles for each food group as would be expected most foods in their nutrientdense forms do contain some sodium and saturated fat in a few cases such as in the case of wholewheat bread the most appropriate representative in current federal databases contains a small amount of added sugars detailed information about the representative foods nutrient profiles and patterns is available in the online appendix of the scientific report of the 2020 dietary guidelines advisory committee1 amounts of each food group and subgroup within the patterns are based on nutrient and dietary guidelines standards see appendix 1 nutritional goals for agesex groups standards for nutrient adequacy aim to meet the recommended dietary allowances rda which are designed to cover the needs of 97 percent of the population and adequate intakes ai which are used when an average nutrient requirement cannot be determined the patterns meet these standards for almost all nutrients for a few nutrients vitamin d and vitamin e for all ages and choline for ages 2 and older amounts in the patterns are marginal or
