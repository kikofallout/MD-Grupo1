At first, plants that grew locally were cultivated, but as time went on, trade brought common and exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays, most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate permits, and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations. China is the largest producer of vegetables, and global trade in agricultural products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries.",

When people experience comorbidity with an eating disorder and OCD, certain aspects of treatment can be negatively impacted. OCD can make it harder to recover from obsession over weight and shape, body dissatisfaction, and body checking. This is in part because ED cognitions serve a similar purpose to OCD obsessions and compulsions (e.g., safety behaviors as temporary relief from anxiety). Research shows OCD does not have an impact on the BMI of patients during treatment.",

Vitamin K includes two natural vitamers: vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) and vitamin K2 (menaquinone). Vitamin K2, in turn, consists of a number of related chemical subtypes, with differing lengths of carbon side chains made of isoprenoid groups of atoms. The two most studied are menaquinone-4 (MK-4) and menaquinone-7 (MK-7). Vitamin K1 is made by plants, and is found in highest amounts in green leafy vegetables, being directly involved in photosynthesis.",

Like the other alkaline earth metals (group 2 of the periodic table), it occurs naturally only in combination with other elements and almost always has an oxidation state of +2. It reacts readily with air to form a thin passivation coating of magnesium oxide that inhibits further corrosion of the metal. The free metal burns with a brilliant-white light. The metal is obtained mainly by electrolysis of magnesium salts obtained from brine. It is less dense than aluminium and is used primarily as a component in strong and lightweight alloys that contain aluminium. ",

This concept represents a change over the previous school of thought that focused on protein loading without emphasizing the synchronicity between eating and exercising. Proper nutrient timing takes into account two dimensions that directly correlate to performance: \n\nThe consumption of the substrates in ideal proportions. The timing between exogenous fueling and exercise. When the right substrates are present at the ideal times, the result might be improved performance and growth.  Nutrient timing may enhance performance of exercise, competition, and daily life expectations. The amount of each nutrient plays a role in performance and recovery.",

For example, if you are simmering a roast at 325°F that would usually take two hours to cook at sea level, that same roast cooked at high altitudes at 325°F would require 2½ hours of cook time. Increasing cook time does not apply to oven-roasted meat or poultry; oven temperatures remain unaffected in high altitudes. Use sea-level cooking instructions for oven baking. Increase Cook Time, Not Heat\n\nHiking up the temperature while boiling foods will not cook food faster. The liquid will simply boil away more quickly and food will dry out.",

The Gregorian calendar, which is followed across much of the world, is a solar calendar based on the number of days it takes the Earth to orbit completely around the sun. To stay in sync with the seasons, the Jewish calendar adds a leap month every couple of years. Additionally, holidays start at sundown on the night before it appears on most American calendars. Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, typically falls in September and is very important to Jews. Ten days later is the very solemn day, Yom Kippur. This is the day of atonement, when religious Jews fast and repent from sundown to sundown.",

People who are permitted to eat or drink often choose to have very little when observing Yom Kippur.  In preparation for the fast, it is recommended to drink enough water the day before the fast and to limit salty or spicy foods that can result in uncomfortable thirst. People who usually consume caffeine may want to gradually cut back ahead of time for an easier adjustment during the fast. The dinner before the fast, called theseuda mafseket, may be a light meal for some families or a large meal for others.",

As elevation increases, the atmospheric pressure decreases, or becomes thinner. The atmosphere becomes drier and liquids evaporate more rapidly, resulting in the need for changes in cooking methods. High altitude is defined as an elevation of 3,000 feet or more above sea level. Even at elevations of 2,000 feet, the temperature of boiling water changes from the standard 212°F at sea level to 208°F.  Boiling or simmering foods at high altitude means lower temperatures and longer cooking times. Ensure your food is cooked long enough yet stays moist and full of flavor with these four tips.",

A second major cause is an age-related decline in stomach acid production (achlorhydria), because acid exposure frees protein-bound vitamin.

Traditional rice polycultures such as rice-duck farming, and modern integrated pest management seek to control damage from pests in a sustainable way. Many varieties of rice have been bred to improve crop quality and productivity. Biotechnology has created Green Revolution rice able to produce high yields when supplied with nitrogen fertiliser and managed intensively.",

There's an opportunity for kids to learn about nutrition in a variety of places — your kitchen, the grocery store or a community garden. Every trip through the supermarket can be a nutrition lesson. Kids can learn to categorize food into groups: grains, fruits, vegetables, dairy and protein foods. They can choose new foods they want to try, including picking out a new fresh, frozen, canned or dried fruit each trip. As children get older, they can help plan the menu at home and then pick out the foods to match the menu items while shopping. ",

It is one of the oldest human-made foods, having been of significance since the dawn of agriculture, and plays an essential role in both religious rituals and secular culture. Bread may be leavened by naturally occurring microbes (e.g. sourdough), chemicals (e.g. baking soda), industrially produced yeast, or high-pressure aeration, which creates the gas bubbles that fluff up bread.

While the intervention positively affected several health parameters, it did not significantly alter BIF abundance. Nevertheless, the abundance of BIF may explain some of these positive outcomes. The findings highlight the potential of plant-based diets to improve overall health, but suggest that further research is needed to understand the role of the gut microbiota in these outcomes.",

An interdisciplinary topic, food choice comprises psychological and sociological aspects (including food politics and phenomena such as vegetarianism or religious dietary laws), economic issues (for instance, how food prices or marketing campaigns influence choice) and sensory aspects (such as the study of the organoleptic qualities of food).  Factors that guide food choice include taste preference, sensory attributes, cost, availability, convenience, cognitive restraint, and cultural familiarity. In addition, environmental cues and increased portion sizes play a role in the choice and amount of foods consumed.

You can start small and gradually increase the size of your garden as you gain experience or, if you want to grow a large garden or sell your produce, you will need to invest more time and money. ",

Its primary role is likely to regulate long-term energy balance.  As one of the major signals of energy status, leptin levels influence appetite, satiety, and motivated behaviors oriented toward the maintenance of energy reserves (e.g., feeding, foraging behaviors).  The amount of circulating leptin correlates with the amount of energy reserves, mainly triglycerides stored in adipose tissue.",

Including whole grains as part of a healthy diet can help reduce the risk for heart disease, diabetes and some cancers.  Barley, quinoa, oats, brown rice, whole-grain pastas, breads and cereals are just some of the whole-grain foods available. When reading food labels, look for the words \"whole grain\" in the ingredient list. Also, choose products high in dietary fiber with fewer added sugars.",

Food colouring is sometimes added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. It can also be made by whisking a flavoured cream base and liquid nitrogen together. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.",

Circulating insulin also affects the synthesis of proteins in a wide variety of tissues. It is thus an anabolic hormone, promoting the conversion of small molecules in the blood into large molecules in the cells. Low insulin in the blood has the opposite effect, promoting widespread catabolism, especially of reserve body fat.  Beta cells are sensitive to blood sugar levels so that they secrete insulin into the blood in response to high level of glucose, and inhibit secretion of insulin when glucose levels are low. Insulin production is also regulated by glucose: high glucose promotes insulin production while low glucose levels lead to lower production.",

Ask: \"How can I make that better for you?\"  This question seems simple, but it can work like magic to open lines of communication between you and your children, and can give kids a feeling of control to make the meal more enjoyable. It also may take the pressure off you, since you won't have to guess what they want — which changes frequently.  Phrasing is key. Instead of a negative question — such as, \"Why don't you like it?\" — a positive question allows for constructive problem-solving and innovative solutions that you create as a team.",

In cold climates, these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before winter; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap in late winter and early spring. Maple trees are tapped by drilling holes into their trunks and collecting the sap, which is processed by heating to evaporate much of the water, leaving the concentrated syrup. Maple syrup was first made by the Indigenous peoples of Northeastern North America. The practice was adopted by European settlers, who gradually changed production methods. Technological improvements in the 1970s further refined syrup processing. Almost all of the world's maple syrup is produced in Canada and the United States.",

One cup of raw kale has only 8 calories and is loaded with vitamins A, C and K, as well as manganese. Kale is great sautéed and cooked in soup, but also is excellent raw in salad; simply remove tough stems, slice into thin slivers and pair with something a bit sweet such as carrots or apples. One advantage of using kale for your leafy greens is that you can add dressing ahead of time; kale becomes more tender and delicious, not wilted.  Pears",

Parents should compare Nutrition Facts labels and select beverages that provide nutrients including calcium, protein and vitamin D and no added sugars. Multiple food allergies can make choosing a milk alternative difficult. Parents should consult a registered dietitian nutritionist about which foods and beverages are best based on their child’s needs. When foods and food groups are avoided, important nutrients may be lacking and an RDN can help to ensure that nutritional needs are being met.",

Remove the tough stems to reduce cooking time and avoid over-cooked greens.  For kale, be sure to choose the right variety. Tougher curly kale is best for adding to soups or stews or for braising. Tender lacinato and baby kale are best in salads.  Preserve nutrients by sautéing greens, rather than boiling. Sauté blanched greens with olive oil, onion and garlic to add flavor.",

Eating too much sodium can increase risk for high blood pressure which can eventually lead to heart disease, stroke and kidney disease. That's cause for concern since the average child consumes more than twice the sodium they need each day.  Choose Spices Over Salt\n\nIn the kitchen, think out of the box. Opt for spices instead of added salt. When you're cooking, reach for low-sodium seasonings such as fresh lemon or lime juice, fresh herbs or salt-free herb blends and vinegar to boost the flavor of your favorite foods. ",

Zeaxanthin in guard cells acts as a blue light photoreceptor which mediates the stomatal opening. Animals derive zeaxanthin from a plant diet. Zeaxanthin is one of the two primary xanthophyll carotenoids contained within the retina of the eye.",

Cooked beans — whether they are purchased frozen, dried or canned — are all good options and a convenient way to get a plant-based source of lean protein.  Croutons typically get a bad rap, but if you make your own and use whole-grain breads, they can help you meet your daily goal for dietary fiber. Another option is to serve a scoop of cooked whole grains, such as quinoa or bulgur, over a mixture of salad greens.",

Here are 10 tips for stretching your food dollar. 1. Plan Menus and Make a List\n\nA sure way to overspend is by wandering aimlessly through the aisles and tossing whatever looks good into your cart. Instead, plan menus and write a shopping list that corresponds with the aisles in your local store. Look for menu planning and recipe help on the supermarket's website. Many feature tools for planning and pricing meals.  2. Use Coupons and Rewards Cards\n\nDid you know the Sunday inserts in your local paper have anywhere from $50 to $75 worth of coupons in them?",

It is produced in many animals, mainly by the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex in an adrenal gland. In other tissues, it is produced in lower quantities. By a diurnal cycle, cortisol is released and increases in response to stress and a low blood-glucose concentration. It functions to increase blood sugar through gluconeogenesis, suppress the immune system, and aid in the metabolism of calories. It also decreases bone formation.",

The analysis revealed that dietary knowledge and food preference can improve an individual's long-term health status significantly.

Beef can be prepared in various ways; cuts are often used for steak, which can be cooked to varying degrees of doneness, while trimmings are often ground or minced, as found in most hamburgers. Beef contains protein, iron, and vitamin B12. Along with other kinds of red meat, high consumption is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer and coronary heart disease, especially when processed. Beef has a high environmental impact, being a primary driver of deforestation with the highest greenhouse gas emissions of any agricultural product.

Choose blueberries that are firm, plump and dusty blue in color. Blackberries should be shiny but not leaking. Raspberries come in a variety of colors; make sure the ones you buy have the right color. For more fun, take your kids berry picking or grow berries at home. When buying frozen berries, shake the bag first. A big lump is a sign of defrost.",

Age and race were not significant predictors. This study highlights the crucial role of environmental factors in shaping dietary habits and underscores the importance of the social components of the food environment in promoting the adoption of healthier dietary habits. Based on these findings, policymakers should prioritize developing strategies that go beyond providing physical access and consider social aspects of the environment in promoting healthy eating habits to improve public health and bolster the food security of communities.",

Such displays often emphasize the complexity of a dish's composition as opposed to its flavors. For instance, ancient sources recall the hosts of Roman banquets adding precious metals and minerals to food in order to enhance its aesthetic appeal. Additionally, medieval aristocrats hosted feasts involving sculptural dishes and shows of live animals. These banquets existed to show the culture and affluence of its host, and were therefore tied to social class. Contemporary food aesthetics reflect the autonomy of the chef, such as in nouvelle cuisine and Japanese bento boxes. Dishes often involve both simplistic and complex designs.",

Organisms obtain nutrients by consuming organic matter, consuming inorganic matter, absorbing light, or some combination of these.

Aquaculture was developed to reduce the demand for wild-caught seafood and help rebuild and replenish global seafood supplies.

Packed with antioxidants, dietary fiber and vitamin C, berries are a nutritional powerhouse.  The amount of fruit per day children need depends on their age, size and activity level. According to MyPlate, young kids (2 to 3 years) need 1 to 1½ cups per day of fruit. Older children (4 to 13 years) need up to 2 cups per day. Most teenagers also need 2 cups per day. Adolescent boys may need more — up to 2½ cups of fruit per day.",

Pack items in the reverse order of when you’ll be using them.",

Vanilla is not autogamous, so pollination is required to make the plants produce the fruit from which the vanilla spice is obtained. In 1837, Belgian botanist Charles François Antoine Morren discovered this fact and pioneered a method of artificially pollinating the plant. The method proved financially unworkable and was not deployed commercially. In 1841, Edmond Albius, a 12-year-old slave who lived on the French island of Réunion in the Indian Ocean, discovered that the plant could be hand-pollinated. Hand-pollination allowed global cultivation of the plant.",

Here are five ways we all can celebrate Native American Heritage Month:  Learn the history of Native American foods that are now eaten all over the world. It's estimated that 60% of the world's crops originated from the Americas. Learning about the cultural significance and evolution of foods previously only known by Indigenous peoples can help cultivate a deeper appreciation and understanding of their history.  Look for collections of Native American history and art. The biggest streaming video platforms — as well as free video collections online — often promote exhibits to celebrate Native American Heritage Month.",

Use soap or hand sanitizer. Wash your hands with soap and warm water, especially before eating and after using the bathroom. When soap and warm water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer instead. Pack it in your carry-on, purse or backpack for easy access. Tip #8: Take Care of Yourself if You Get Sick\n\nStay hydrated. Even if you play it safe and follow the rules for food safety, you still may find yourself sick while on an international trip.

The concept of mineral is distinct from rock, which is any bulk solid geologic material that is relatively homogeneous at a large enough scale.",

The intervention sought to enhance adolescents' knowledge about nutrition, foster self-regulation skills, and ultimately improve their overall health, including their body mass index (BMI). Through a multi-component approach that combined theoretical learning with practical activities and the integration of digital tools such as the MyFitnessPal app, the study targeted improvements in food literacy, which encompasses nutrition knowledge, food label interpretation skills, and cooking abilities. These elements are critical in influencing adolescents' food choices and eating behaviors, with a focus on increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables while reducing the intake of fast food and processed snacks.",

Food hypersensitivity is used to refer broadly to both food intolerances and food allergies.  Food allergies are immune reactions, typically an IgE reaction caused by the release of histamine but also encompassing non-IgE immune responses. This mechanism causes allergies to typically give immediate reaction (a few minutes to a few hours) to foods. Food intolerances can be classified according to their mechanism.",

Help make sure your kids have an appetite. Many kids aren't hungry for breakfast because they snack too much at night. Try offering lighter snacks in the evening and you might be surprised how much hungrier they are in the morning. In addition, try having your children dress first and eat second. Kids are more likely to feel hungry once they have a chance to wake up.  Be a positive role model. Children will mimic their parents' behavior, so make it a habit to sit down and eat a nutritious breakfast with your kids every morning.",

Food preservation may also include processes that inhibit visual deterioration, such as the enzymatic browning reaction in apples after they are cut during food preparation. By preserving food, food waste can be reduced, which is an important way to decrease production costs and increase the efficiency of food systems, improve food security and nutrition and contribute towards environmental sustainability. For instance, it can reduce the environmental impact of food production.  Many processes designed to preserve food involve more than one food preservation method.",

It is used for detoxification, an alternative medicine treatment, and is often part of detox diets. The diet can typically last from one to seven days and involve a number of fruits and vegetables and even spices that are not among the juices typically sold or consumed in the average Western diet.

However, populations of several species are restricted to fresh waters (i.e. landlocked) throughout their lives. Folklore has it that the fish return to the exact stream where they themselves hatched to spawn, and tracking studies have shown this to be mostly true. A portion of a returning salmon run may stray and spawn in different freshwater systems; the percent of straying depends on the species of salmon.

Proponents of the diet believe that certain foods can affect the acidity (pH) of the body and that the change in pH can therefore be used to treat or prevent disease.

At checkout, put meat, poultry and fish in a plastic bag before placing in a tote. Keep these items in a separate bag away from ready-to-eat foods. This will help prevent juices from leaking and contaminating your reusable bags and food.

The term is most commonly applied to round, orange-colored squash varieties, but does not possess a scientific definition. It may be used in reference to many different squashes of varied appearance and belonging to multiple species in the Cucurbita genus.  The use of the word \"pumpkin\" is thought to have originated in New England in North America, derived from a word for melon, or a native word for round.",

If the fresh meat is a steak, roast or chop, then yes — medium-rare can be safe. That means the meat needs to reach 145°F internally and stand for three or more minutes before cutting or consuming.

When food is held at a proper temperature, the growth of bacteria slows down, which helps reduce the risk of food poisoning.  To keep your perishable foods fresh, make sure your refrigerator is set at or below 40°F. This will help keep foods out of what's called the “temperature danger zone.\" This zone is the temperature range where bacteria multiply quickest, between 40°F and 140°F. Keep a refrigerator thermometer inside your refrigerator in the front where it can be easily read to help make sure you’re in the right zone. ",

This process compounds in intensity and frequency and continues until the triggering activity ceases. A similar process takes place during lactation and during sexual activity.

First established in the late 1970s as Asian/Pacific American Heritage Week, the celebration of Asians and Pacific Islanders in the United States was officially expanded to the entire month by Congress in the early 1990s. According to the celebration's officialwebsite, the month of May was chosen to \"commemorate the immigration of the first Japanese people to the United States on May 7, 1843, and to mark the anniversary of the completion of the transcontinental railroad on May 10, 1869,” which was built largely through the efforts of Chinese workers.

The occurrence of two or more cases of a similar illness resulting from the ingestion of a common food is known as a food-borne disease outbreak. This includes a number of routines that should be followed to avoid potential health hazards. In this way, food safety often overlaps with food defense to prevent harm to consumers. The tracks within this line of thought are safety between industry and the market and then between the market and the consumer.",

Allergies occur when immunoglobulin E (IgE), part of the body's immune system, binds to food molecules. A protein in the food is usually the problem.

Diagnosis is usually based on a medical history, elimination diet, skin prick test, blood tests for food-specific IgE antibodies, or oral food challenge.  Management involves avoiding the food in question and having a plan if exposure occurs. This plan may include giving adrenaline (epinephrine) and wearing medical alert jewelry.",

In the form of a natural crystalline mineral, salt is also known as rock salt or halite. Salt is essential for life in general (being the source of the essential dietary minerals sodium and chlorine), and saltiness is one of the basic human tastes. Salt is one of the oldest and most ubiquitous food seasonings, and is known to uniformly improve the taste perception of food, including otherwise unpalatable food. Salting, brining, and pickling are ancient and important methods of food preservation.",

Consider these factors:\n\nThe amount of sunlight each area gets; some plants need full sun while others tolerate partial shade.\n\nThe condition of the soil and its pH level (a measure of how acidic the soil is); most vegetable and fruit plants grow best when pH is near neutral or between 5.5 to 7.",

Food allergies are immune reactions, typically an IgE reaction caused by the release of histamine but also encompassing non-IgE immune responses.

Green bananas are harvested on farms, then placed into a room where ethylene gas is pumped in and out to enhance the ripening process. When the color begins to “break,” meaning a yellow hue is faintly seen, bananas are packaged and shipped to retailers. The remainder of the ripening continues naturally en route.  The high demand for bananas has drawn environmental concerns. Although thousands of varieties exist, the familiar crescent-shaped Cavendish banana accounts for the majority of the world’s exports.",

Its effects are mediated through the activation of melatonin receptors and its role as an antioxidant. In plants and bacteria, melatonin primarily serves as a defense mechanism against oxidative stress, indicating its evolutionary significance.",

Who Is at Risk for Food Poisoning?  Everyone has some risk of getting food poisoning, but some people are at greater risk of developing serious illness with long-term effects. These high-risk groups include older adults, infants and young children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems and chronic illness such as diabetes, kidney disease, HIV/AIDS and some cancer patients.

To examine the currently existing birth cohort studies examining child eating behaviours, a review was conducted. There are currently no birth cohorts that concurrently examine child eating behaviours, dietary intake, growth and parental feeding practices from birth into early childhood. Therefore, the primary objective of the Longitudinal Assessment of Children's Eating (LACE) study is to examine the bidirectional and transactional processes of child eating behaviours and parental feeding practices explaining poor dietary intake and excess weight across infancy and early childhood.<h4 >",

These proposed specific combinations are promoted as central to good health as well as improved digestion and weight loss, despite having no sufficient evidence for these claims. It proposes a list of rules that advocate for eating or not eating certain foods together, including to avoid eating starches and proteins together; always eat fruit before, and not after, a meal; avoid eating fruits and vegetables together in the same meal; and to not drink cold water during a meal.  Food combining was originally promoted by Herbert M. Shelton in his book Food Combining Made Easy (1951), but the issue had been previously discussed by Edgar Cayce.",

Bees produce honey by gathering and then refining the sugary secretions of plants (primarily floral nectar) or the secretions of other insects, like the honeydew of aphids. This refinement takes place both within individual bees, through regurgitation and enzymatic activity, and during storage in the hive, through water evaporation that concentrates the honey's sugars until it is thick and viscous.  Honey bees stockpile honey in the hive. Within the hive is a structure made from wax called honeycomb.",

Everyone shares a physiological need for energy and adequate amounts, types and combinations of nutrients. People source their energy and nutrient needs from foods that are themselves sourced from food systems. The physiological need and food systems' sustainability have been shaped through evolutionary and ecological processes, respectively. This physiological need can be met, and food systems' sustainability protected, by following three interlinked dietary principles: (i) Variety - to help achieve a nutritionally adequate diet and help protect the biodiversity of food systems .",

The diet took inspiration from the eating habits and traditional food typical of Crete, much of the rest of Greece, and southern Italy, and formulated in the early 1960s. It is distinct from Mediterranean cuisine, which covers the actual cuisines of the Mediterranean countries, and from the Atlantic diet of northwestern Spain and Portugal. While inspired by a specific time and place, the \"Mediterranean diet\" was later refined based on the results of multiple scientific studies.  This approach emphasizes a plant-based diet, focusing on unprocessed cereals, legumes, vegetables, and fruits.",

This day coincides with Columbus Day to acknowledge the inhabitants of the Americas prior to Christopher Columbus' arrival; to raise awareness of the historical and current experiences of American Indians, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians; and to honor these communities' substantial and ongoing contributions.

Naturally occurring potassium is composed of three isotopes, of which 40K is radioactive. Traces of 40K are found in all potassium, and it is the most common radioisotope in the human body.  Potassium ions are vital for the functioning of all living cells. The transfer of potassium ions across nerve cell membranes is necessary for normal nerve transmission; potassium deficiency and excess can each result in numerous signs and symptoms, including an abnormal heart rhythm and various electrocardiographic abnormalities. Fresh fruits and vegetables are good dietary sources of potassium.",

As an agricultural product, dairy milk is collected from farm animals, mostly cattle. In 2011, dairy farms produced around 730 million tonnes (800 million short tons) of milk from 260 million dairy cows. India is the world's largest producer of milk and the leading exporter of skimmed milk powder. New Zealand, Germany, and the Netherlands are the largest exporters of milk products. Between 750 and 900 million people live in dairy-farming households.",

In addition to their tissue-building function, they affect body composition and regulate various metabolic pathways, as well as satiety and immune system activity. Protein use can be examined from a quantitative or qualitative viewpoint. In this scoping review, we compare animal- and plant-based protein sources in terms of their effects on human health and the environment. We conclude that the consumption of vegetable protein sources is associated with better health outcomes overall (namely, on the cardiovascular system) than animal-based product use. The healthier outcomes of vegetable protein sources dovetail with their lower environmental impact, which must be considered when designing an optimal diet.",

There are both edible and industrial forms produced from rapeseed, the seed of several cultivars of the plant family Brassicaceae. Historically, it was restricted as a food oil due to its content of erucic acid. Laboratory studies about this acid have shown damage to the cardiac muscle of laboratory animals in high quantities. It also imparts a bitter taste, and glucosinolates, which made many parts of the plant less nutritious in animal feed. Rapeseed oil from standard cultivars can contain up to 54% erucic acid. ",
