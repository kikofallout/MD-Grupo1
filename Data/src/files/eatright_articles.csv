For some vegetarians and vegans, however, this means making do at backyard picnics with the same old appetizers or soggy green salads. But barbecues don't have to be a washout for those who don't eat meat.

Classic cookout foods can easily be transformed into delicious vegetarian or vegan fare.

Main Dishes

When hosting, be sure to offer some sort of plant-based protein, which can be as simple as achilled bean salad! You'll also find meat-free burgers and hot dogs in most grocery stores. Or, if you're feeling adventurous, make your ownhomemade burgers out of beans, rice, grains or tofu. If you're makingchilifor meat eaters, simply make another batch without the meat; add extra beans and veggies to thicken.

Side Dishes

Frompasta saladandquinoa saladtopickled veggiesandpico de gallo, there are lots of plant-based options to serve at your cookout.

Grilled vegetables are satisfying no matter your eating pattern! Marinated and grilled portobello mushroom caps are tasty and offer a savory flavor that can be appealing to vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike. Or skewer mushrooms, peppers, squash and tomatoes, then grill them until slightly charred.

Deviled eggs, potato salad and macaroni salads are possible food choices for lacto-ovo vegetarians, and can be modified for vegans by altering some of these recipes by substituting certain ingredients with dairy- and egg-free products. Try a vinegar-based dressing for  broccoli orgreen bean salad. Or make asimple chopped saladusing canned chickpeas, tomatoes, cucumber and bell peppers.

For a more nutritious chip option, offer guests homemade kale orcollard chips. Another traditional favorite  is grilled corn on the cob.

Desserts

You can't go wrong with fresh seasonal fruit such as watermelon slices and an assortment of berries. If you're looking for something more indulgent, soy, almond, cashew and coconut milk-based ice creams command more shelf space in today's frozen food aisle, and for good reason — they taste absolutely delicious! And if you want to join in for some s'mores around the campfire, gelatin-free marshmallows guarantee your place. Grilling? Try peaches, mangoes, pineapples, bananas and other fruit. The heat caramelizes their natural sweetness.

On the Road

New vegetarians and vegans often find it difficult to ask hosts about food — what will be served and how it will be prepared. Most hosts, however, want their guests to enjoy themselves, so let them know you follow a vegetarian or vegan diet. You may be pleasantly surprised with their response. Some hosts will even go so far as to prepare dishes that are vegetarian- or vegan-friendly or at least won't mind if you bring your own food.

If most dishes include meat, dairy, eggs or cheese, offer to bring food to share with the crowd so you won't go hungry. As a courtesy, let the host know, as there may already be a crowded refrigerator or limited oven space, in which case, you can bring your own cooler or decide on a different recipe.

You'll also want to follow good food safety practices. Bacteria grow rapidly between 40 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit, and vegetarians and vegans aren't immune from food poisoning. Keep perishable foods in the refrigerator until you're ready to leave, and then keep cold foods chilled in an ice-filled cooler or by packing with frozen gel packs. If you’re bringing foods that are already hot, transport them in a thermal container to help them retain their heat. These foods should be reheated to a minimum internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit once you arrive.

Bacteria multiply at room temperature. Keep foods like eggs and dairy products chilled on ice while serving to help maintain their proper temperature. Otherwise, any perishable foods that are left out at room temperature for more than two hours (or just one hour if the temperature is over 90 degrees Fahrenheit) will need to be discarded. The same goes for cut fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as cooked food.

If refrigeration is unavailable to you or it will be difficult keeping foods cold, consider packing non-perishable foods that don't need refrigeration such as whole fruits and vegetables (wash before eating), chips, bread, crackers, nuts, peanut butter and condiments.",food-preparation
Produce from Purchase to Plate — Steps to Reduce Food Waste,https://www.eatright.org/food/planning/food-security-and-sustainability/produce-from-purchase-to-plate-steps-to-reduce-food-waste,"Contributors:Jackie Newgent, RDN, CDNReviewers:Academy Staff RDNsPublished:September 17, 2020Reviewed:March 13, 2025

Reviewed:March 13, 2025","In 2024, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a joint paper on strategies for reducing wasted food in America. They estimated that an average family of four spends about $1,500 on food each year that goes uneaten.

Why Does This Matter?

According to the USDA’sThrifty Food Planin 2021, a family of four may spend around $835 a month on groceries. This puts the cost of food waste at nearly the same amount as two months of food.

While there are many areas of food waste that are out of consumers' control, including food lost during production, processing and at market, we can be conscientious and take proper care of vegetables and fruits after they’re brought home. By doing so, we can save money, have a greater ability to feed people who are hungry and play a positive role in the reduction of food waste, which means a reduction in landfill use and the corresponding methane emissions.

Four Steps to Reduce Waste

1. Select Fruits and Vegetables Wisely.

Buy just what you need. Beware of bulk discounts, especially on fresh produce, since it has a limited shelf life.

Purchase fresh produce toward the end of shopping trips so cold foods stay cold longer.

Shop farmers markets early because the heat of the day can alter quality or hasten ripening.

Don't hunt for perfect. Embrace produce imperfections but steer clear of vegetables or fruits that are overly bruised or damaged.

2. Store Produce Properly.

Store any perishable fresh produce, such as berries and leafy greens, in a clean refrigerator set to 40°F or below. If produce is refrigerated at a grocery store, it generally should be refrigerated at home to maintain quality.

Some fruits produce a large amount of ethylene gas during ripening, which can ripen other produce when stored together. Produce that releases this gas include avocados, unripe bananas, nectarines, peaches, tomatoes, apples, apricots, cantaloupe, figs, kiwis and plums. In the refrigerator, store these fruits in a no-vegetables-allowed crisper drawer and away from fruit that doesn't need to be quickly ripened. Some vegetables also can leave distinctive odors that fruits absorb, affecting overall quality.

After a fruit or vegetable ripens, it can be refrigerated. However, cold temperatures can cause flavor and moisture changes in some produce.

Some produce has a short lifespan once ripened. Plan to use fruits such as apricots and berries and vegetables such as herbs, cucumbers, eggplant, green beans, leafy greens and mushrooms within a couple days of purchase.

Fresh produce with a longer shelf life can wait to be consumed until after most of the other fruits and vegetables have been used. This includes apples, pears, beets, carrots, garlic, onions, potatoes and winter squash. Eating foods with a short shelf life first can be helpful in reducing food waste.

Consider using bags or storage containers designed for produce to help prevent spoilage of other foods. However, don't store fresh produce in regular, air-tight plastic storage bags or containers as this can start the decaying process and promotes bacterial and mold growth.

3. Prepare Fruits and Vegetables Cleverly.

Rinse or scrub and use the entire fruit or vegetable when possible, including all edible skins and seeds. Just cut away any bruises and blemishes.

Have a plan, then prepare only what you need. Make half portions or develop a plan for using leftovers to help reduce excess food that might go to waste.

If you're unable to enjoy all of the fresh produce you have on hand, make your own frozen food. Cut fruit and blanch vegetables before placing in air-tight containers for freezing. Blanching vegetables before freezing helps to slow down the spoiling process and preserve the color and texture of these foods.

Be playful when produce is at the end of its edible life. Puree fruits into smoothies or vegetables into a hummus. Mash fruit to create fresh jam or pancake topping. Finely dice fruit to make a salsa. Sauté cut-up vegetables and toss with pasta or sprinkle atop cheese pizza. Roast vegetables and stuff into a burrito or sandwich wrap.

4. Compost the Scraps.

Composting can help put food scraps to use and reduce methane emissions in landfills. Fruits, vegetables, coffee and tea all are good materials for compost.

By taking care of produce from purchase to plate, you can make a noticeable difference in the amount of food wasted in your home!",planning

Here, we give you the scoop on a few unexpected toppings that will boost the flavor and nutrient content of your salad. Using small amounts and different combinations of ingredients can help add variety to salads.

Salads in Bloom

Your salad has greens, veggies, even fruits — so why not go further into the garden and add flowers too? Edible flowers, which include marigolds, violets, roses, nasturtiums, chive blossoms and pansies, can add color and flavor to salad. Just be sure to use flowers that are labeled as edible, like the ones you can find in the produce section at the grocery store. Other blooms, which are sold at nurseries and florists, may be toxic or grown with dangerous pesticides. Kitchen herb gardens also work well as a way to produce both flowers and plants for edible purposes.

Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme

Herbs, whether fresh or dried, are another way to add flavor to salads. Many supermarkets offer fresh herbs already packaged or as plants. Both fresh and dried herbs can be sprinkled on top as garnishes or used to make flavorful vinaigrettes or salad dressings. Try experimenting with different combinations, but start small and build flavor. If a recipe calls for dried herbs and you want to substitute with fresh, remember that 1 teaspoon of dried is equal to 1 tablespoon (3 teaspoons) of fresh snipped herbs.

Going Green

Avocados not only taste great, but also are a good source of heart-healthy monounsaturated fat and contain several vitamins and minerals, including vitamin E and potassium. They also provide dietary fiber, which most Americans don’t get enough of. Avocados are very versatile, too. For example, they can be chopped up and added as a salad ingredient or pureed into a dressing. It’s best to prepare them right before serving, because once an avocado is sliced, it will start to discolor. A little squeeze of lemon or lime juice can help prevent it from browning.

Texture You Can Sink Your Teeth Into

Nuts and seeds not only add interesting flavors to foods, but the crunch they provide can be just what a salad needs sometimes. Sprinkle on small amounts of nuts and seeds, such as walnuts, pecans, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds or even pine nuts. They provide unique flavors and textures when used as salad toppings.

Another ingredient that can make a salad more satisfying are beans. There are so many varieties to experiment with, but more common types used in salads include black beans, chickpeas (also known as garbanzo beans) and edamame. Cooked beans — whether they are purchased frozen, dried or canned — are all good options and a convenient way to get a plant-based source of lean protein.

Croutons typically get a bad rap, but if you make your own and use whole-grain breads, they can help you meet your daily goal for dietary fiber. Another option is to serve a scoop of cooked whole grains, such as quinoa or bulgur, over a mixture of salad greens. It's a great way to get the best of both food groups at one meal.

Looking for ways to get more calcium and vitamin D in your diet? A sprinkle of shredded cheese, such as mozzarella or Parmesan, or crumbled feta can add a lot of flavor with just a small amount. Plus, they are good sources of calcium. Eggs provide vitamin D and when hard boiled, make a great topping for salads.

A Touch of Sweetness

We all know that berries, apples, oranges and pears taste great on their own, but paired with salad greens, the combination of flavors can be extraordinary. Dried fruits, including cherries, cranberries, apricots or raisins, can liven up a salad and may be more convenient to use at certain times of the year. Plus, their flavor has been concentrated, so a smaller amount of dried fruit will provide the same intense flavor as its fresh, whole form.

Dressing It Up

Go for oil-based dressings, like vinaigrettes, more often than those made with ingredients such as mayonnaise. Oils, which are considered a healthier form of fat, are needed on a regular basis but only in small amounts. They provide important nutrients and help with the absorption of others, including vitamins A, D, E and K. Fats also help promote a feeling of fullness.

Variety is Key

Try experimenting with different recipes and an assortment of different colored vegetables to keep the salad combinations exciting and healthful. Being mindful of portions and choosing ingredients that pack a lot of flavor and texture in small amounts will also help. Plus, it will prevent your taste buds from becoming bored.",food-preparation

Reduce your risk of food poisoning with these tips to keep food safe as it travels from the kitchen to the school cafeteria or office.

The one- to two-hour countdown starts the minute you make lunch, not when you get to school or the office.

Invest in an insulated lunch box for every member of the family and don't forget to wash the lunch boxes on a daily basis.

Find out if your children have access to a refrigerator at school, and instruct them to put lunches in the refrigerator as soon as they get to school. Take your own advice and put your lunch in the refrigerator or freezer as soon as you arrive at work.

Always include a frozen icepack (even in an insulated lunch box) to keep perishable foods cold until lunchtime. You also can freeze an individual juice box or bottle of water to serve as an ice pack. By lunchtime, the juice or water should be thawed and ready to drink and foods should still be cold.

If refrigeration is unavailable at your child's school or if you tend to forget to put your lunch in the refrigerator or freezer when you get to the office, pack shelf-stable foods such as trail mix, cereal, granola bars, bagels, nuts and seeds, carrot and celery sticks, cherry tomatoes, whole fruit, dried fruit, single-serve applesauce and whole-grain crackers.

About to cook that frozen meal you left on your desk all morning? Stop! Frozen meals are not meant to be defrosted before cooking.

It's not just about keeping cold foods cold — keeping hot foods hot is just as important. Fill an insulated bottle with boiling water to preheat the container before storing foods such as soup, chili or stew. These items also can be packed and stored cold, then reheated when you’re ready to eat.

Don't keep lunch leftovers for an afternoon snack, unless they are put back in the refrigerator within two hours, and tell your kids to always throw away perishable foods right after lunch.",home-food-safety

For the best cleaning results, always refer to the owner's manual of your refrigerator, but a few simple refrigerator cleaning tips work in most situations:

Refrigerator Cleaning

Wipe up spills immediately, especially juices from raw meat, chicken or fish. Defrosting meats on the bottom shelf in a covered container reduces the chance of a spill and cross-contamination.

Scrub down the inside of your refrigerator (including shelves and drawers) using a clean sponge and warm soapy water. Rinse with clean water, then dry with paper towels or a clean cloth. Avoid using cleaners that may pass on flavors to food or cause damage to surfaces.

Frequently clean the refrigerator handle. That is the part of the fridge that gets touched countless times a day.

Keep the front grill clear of dust to allow free airflow to the condenser for best cooling and efficiency. Also, clean the condenser coils with a brush or vacuum. Unplug the refrigerator when cleaning the coils.

What's In the Refrigerator?

Sort through foods at least once a week, throwing out foods that have been ""hibernating"" and are expired or no longer suitable for eating. Consider labeling foods with the dates they were made to keep track of their freshness. Leftovers usually last three to four days in the refrigerator, whereas fresh fish, poultry and ground beef are best consumed within one to two days of purchase, and whole cuts of fresh beef, such as steaks, are best consumed within the first five days of purchase.

Except for infant formulas, product dates are not expiration dates. They indicate when a product should be used for best quality. The terms ""sell by,"" ""best by"" and ""use by,"" may give you a reference for how long a food might last. However, if you aren't sure how old something is or if it's safe to eat, remember — when in doubt, throw it out.",home-food-safety
What is a Sustainable Food System?,https://www.eatright.org/food/planning/food-security-and-sustainability/what-is-a-sustainable-food-system,"Contributors:Marissa Thiry, MS, RDPublished:February 24, 2023
Published:February 24, 2023","The effects of climate change impact the health of both people and the environment. To minimize the impact and feed a growing population, which is estimated to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, food systems are incorporating more sustainable practices including reducing food waste and conserving resources.

Sustainable food systems

A “food system” is a broad term that describes anything involved in the production, distribution and consumption of food. This includes growing, raising, harvesting, processing, distributing, ensuring food safety, eating and even discarding of food. It also includes the connection of these processes and the people and resources that contribute to and are impacted by the food system.

The sustainability of a food system impacts everyone. Food systems shape what foods are available for people to eat, how easy they are to get and how much they cost.

A “sustainable food system” provides nutrition and food security for everyone without compromising the well-being of people or the planet now and in the future. While the topic of sustainability grows and the definition evolves, most experts agree that sustainable food systems address three key factors: economic, environmental and social.

The key factors of a sustainable food system impact us in different ways. The economic, or financial, goal of a sustainable food system is to benefit everyone involved in the system. This includes providing livable wages for food system employees, tax profits for governments, profits for the businesses involved in the food system and safe, nutritious, affordable and available food for all.

The social aspect of a sustainable food system involves fairness and equity for all participants, including vulnerable and underrepresented groups. This means promoting good health among workers, respecting cultural traditions, providing a safe work environment and animal well-being.

The environmental goal of a sustainable food system is to achieve a neutral or positive effect on the natural environment. This includes retaining biodiversity (which refers to the variety of species in our food supply and environment), limiting water use, prioritizing the health of animals and plants, minimizing food loss and waste and cutting down the amount of carbon in the atmosphere that contributes to climate change.

Balancing all factors

When developing sustainable food systems, economic, social and environmental impacts must be considered — as well as potential unintended outcomes. For example, improvements in technology may increase profits for investors (an economic benefit) and efficiencies in production but may result in job loss for farm workers. Alternatively, implementing new animal well-being practices at a farm would have social and environmental benefits but may require additional costs or labor, which impacts the economic aspect of the food system.

How you can help

Developing sustainable food systems requires action from all people involved. While individual efforts like recycling and reducing food waste are important, fundamental changes to the way food is produced, distributed and eaten, as well as changes to policies and infrastructure, also are needed to make lasting change.

Here are two ways you can help:

Education. Learn about recycling programs and other opportunities to conserve resources in your community. If applicable, advocate for sustainability at your workplace by sharing your knowledge with others and proposing impactful changes such as placing recycling and composting bins in cafeterias and break areas.

Action. Taking steps to reduce food waste, such as meal planning before grocery shopping, embracing leftovers and composting are great ways to do your part in your own kitchen. Consider supporting and purchasing from food brands that incorporate sustainable practices into their production and distribution. Most companies have this information available on their website.

Together, individual actions in addition to large-scale changes at the local, state, federal and global levels can create a sustainable food system.",planning

Fares of Faith: Krishna Janmashtami,https://www.eatright.org/food/cultural-cuisines-and-traditions/holidays-and-celebrations/krishna-janmashtami,"Contributors:Traci PedersenPublished:July 25, 2023
Published:July 25, 2023","Krishna Janmashtami, or simplyJanmashtami, is the two-day birthday celebration of the Hindu deity Lord Krishna. The holiday is celebrated throughout India and in Hindu homes around the world, but the spirit of devotion is especially prevalent in the ancient cities Mathura and Vrindavan, where Krishna spent his childhood.

Hindus believe Lord Krishna is the personification of love, joy and knowledge. He is considered the most personable Hindu deity, always ready to answer the prayers of his followers. A brave hero, wise teacher and loving friend to all, Krishna has had an overwhelming influence on Indian philosophy and culture.

The legend ofJanmashtamibegins about 5,000 years ago, when Mother Earth and her children were grieving terribly under the dark rule of the demon kings. The outlook was so bleak that Lord Vishnu, the Godhead of the Hindu trinity, chose to be reborn as baby Krishna to bring love and peace to the world and end the rule of evil kings.

Celebration and Fasting

Janmashtamifestivities last two full days, which generally fall in August or September. Devotees spend the first day of festivities fasting, singing and preparing Krishna’s favorite foods — mostly sweet, milk-based dishes — to offer their Lord at midnight. Beautifully decorated temples and homes exude an aroma of rich desserts and flavorful spices.

Many devotees fast on the first day ofJanmashtami. In Hinduism, fasting is considered a sacrificial gift that allows individuals to grow closer to God and repent for sins. In a phalahar fast, worshippers are allowed to consume fruit, water and milk but must refrain from cereal and salt. The most devoted followers keep anirjalfast, which excludes food and water. During the fast, devotees spend the day preparing Krishna’s favorite dishes, singing songs and chanting mantras. At midnight, the carefully prepared food offering, orprasad, is given to Krishna. Fasting is broken by eating theprasad.

Temples at Midnight

Festivities peak at midnight, the time of Krishna’s birth. Devotees flock to temples adorned with sparkling lights, hanging flowers and colorful decorations. Holy mantras are chanted, and a conch is blown to symbolize the destruction of evil. A representation Krishna, such as a small statue or figurine, is bathed in a mixture of honey, ghee, sugar and curds, then placed in a cradle. It is believed that those who visit the temple to rock the cradle will have a wish granted. The sweet aroma of Krishna’s favorite dishes fills the air as they are placed in front of the cradle. Some Krishna temples prepare as many as 108 dishes, a sacred number in Hinduism.

Breaking the Butter Pot

Dairy products, such as milk, butter and curds, are important staples of Indian cuisine. This is reflected in one of the holiday’s most beloved traditions,Dahi Handi. This ritual, carried out on the second day of festivities, is a celebration of Krishna’s playful and mischievous side. In a daring public display of acrobatic strength and balance,Dahi Handiparticipants, orgovindas, build a human pyramid to reach a dangling butter pot suspended out of reach. The lastgovindaclimbs to the top and strikes the pot until it cracks, spilling curds onto those below.

According to legend, the children of Vrindavan village were deprived of milk products because every drop had to be given to Mathura, the home of evil King Kansa. In response, Krishna and his friends made a human pyramid to reach the pots hanging from ceilings and distribute the prized butter to local children.

Foods ofJanmashtami

Food prepared as an offering for Krishna is made with only the finest ingredients in highly sanitary conditions. Because Krishna was known for his sweet tooth and love of milk products, most dishes prepared forJanmashtamiare desserts with a milk or yogurt base. Meals are typically vegetarian, as Hindus strongly promote nonviolence and believe all animals have souls. As providers of precious milk, cows are considered sacred in Hinduism, so there are no holiday beef dishes.

Who knows best? The person with special dietary needs! Once you have a menu in mind, discuss it with your guests ahead of time and ask how they can best be accommodated.

2. Read Labels

Dairy, gluten, nuts and non-vegetarian ingredients are found in many packaged foods. If you are not sure if an ingredient is safe for your party guests, ask the person you're accommodating or skip it.

3. Don't Cross-Contaminate

Use separate tongs when preparing meats and vegetarian options to spare the meatless foods from meat juices. Don't bake a nut-free cookie on the same tray you used to roast almonds. Thoroughly wash the strainer in between draining whole-wheat spaghetti noodles and gluten-free ones.

Being mindful of opportunities for cross-contamination can lower the risk of serving foods that your guest might not be able to eat.

4. Make Simple Swaps

Tossing veggies with olive oil instead of butter means that those with dairy allergies or observing a vegan diet can eat them, too. Use vegetable stock instead of chicken or beef stock for meat-free side dishes and soups, so more people can enjoy them.

5. Leave the Toppings on the Side

Sometimes it's just one or two ingredients that rule out a dish for those with dietary issues. If you leave certain items on the side, like bacon crumbles, nuts or croutons, those who have food restrictions can still eat the main dish, while those without food restrictions can add toppings.

6. Build a Bowl

Rather than designing a menu with several parts, build a buffet of toppings and let your guests do the rest. From a yogurt parfait brunch to a smoky burrito bowl, there are many options for having a casual meal that is satisfying for everyone. Offering a diverse spread of options will allow your guests to create a meal that suits their needs.

7. Serve Delicious Drinks

Even those not drinking alcohol enjoy fancy mocktails. Include everyone in the festivities by making a pitcher or two of fruit- and herb-infused waters or a dry bar with seltzer, juices and herbs.

8. Polish Your Sales Pitch

We tend to be wary of foods we cannot easily identify. To encourage everyone to try different dishes, write the menu on a chalkboard or place a menu card on the table. On your buffet line, label each dish with enticing adjectives and include a list of their ingredients. This not only encourages a picky eater to try new things, but also helps guests avoid food allergens.

9. Have Fun!

Remember: You don't have to accommodate your guests for every single dish. If your holiday dinner would not be complete without your grandmother's Yorkshire pudding, include it. Missing your personal favorites might lower your own enjoyment at the occasion. With a well-planned dinner, all of your guests can be happy and well fed.",cultural-cuisines-and-traditions
Getting Groceries During Quarantine,https://www.eatright.org/food/planning/smart-shopping/getting-groceries-during-quarantine,"Contributors:Sarah Klemm, RDN, CD, LDNPublished:February 29, 2020Reviewed:March 19, 2020

Reviewed:March 19, 2020","There may be times when you need to limit your trips to the grocery store. Here are some tips to help you make healthful decisions and reduce your trips to the store.

Keep a Well-Stocked Pantry

Planning out a menu for a week or two in advance can be helpful, but if you don’t have time to plan meals, a well-stocked pantry can relieve some of the pressure when it comes time to make a meal. Keep the following on hand for quick, easy-to-fix dishes.

Shelf-stable Products

Dried or canned beans, peas and lentils (such as black, garbanzo, kidney, white and pinto beans; green, yellow or split peas and lentils)

Canned vegetables with no added salt (such as tomatoes, green beans and corn)

Dried or canned fruit in 100% fruit juice

Whole grains (such as brown rice, quinoa, oats, millet and whole-wheat pasta)

Pouches or cans of fish and chicken

Nuts, seeds, and nut butters

Olive, canola or other vegetable oils

Dried herbs and spices

Frozen Foods

Vegetables (such as broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and Brussels sprouts)

Fruit (such as berries and cherries )

Whole wheat pizza dough

Poultry

Seafood

When thinking about what to make at home, consider foods that also freeze well. Casseroles, soups, muffins and breads are easy to portion out and store in the freezer in individual containers. These foods can be frozen for 2 to 3 months without significant loss to quality.

Plan Meals Based on the Foods You Already Have

Looking for healthful ways to reduce your trips to the store? Get creative with what you have on hand.

Check the refrigerator, freezer and pantry for foods that need to be used up. Leftover meats and veggies can easily be transformed into meals by cutting them up and adding to soups, salads or sandwiches. Ideas may include using meats and veggies as:

Toppings for salads or cooked grains like rice or pasta.

Filling for a tortilla or stuffed into a pita for a satisfying sandwich.

Ingredients to make soup, then enjoy or freeze for future use.

Or simply save leftovers for lunch or a meal later in the week. However, keep in mind that leftovers should be used within three to four days and reheated to a minimum internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit.

Freeze leftovers or perishables you know you won’t eat before they spoil and be mindful of portion sizes. Choose smaller portions to stay within your calorie needs, as MyPlate recommends. Use smaller plates, bowls and glasses to help keep portions under control. Being mindful of portion sizes can also help food last longer.

Master the Shelf Life of Foods

Many foods and drinks purchased at the grocery store include a date, which indicates when it should be used or sold by. Because these dates refer to the product's quality, it doesn’t necessarily mean they should be thrown out.

For products that don't require refrigeration until after opening, such as mustard, salad dressing and ketchup, it’s often safe to eat these beyond the date on their label as long as they have been stored properly. Perishable foods, such as meats and dairy products, may be used a few days after that date, as long as they were stored at a safe temperature.

When in doubt, check the FoodKeeper App online and discard any foods that have developed an off odor or texture.

When You Have to Go to the Store

To help you reduce the amount of time you spend at the store, create a plan before you go. Deciding on meals and snacks before you shop can save both time and money. Review recipes and make a grocery list of what ingredients are needed, then check to see what foods you already have on hand and make a list for what you still need to buy.

Organize your list according to the section of the store these items are located in. This will prevent you from having to run from one end of the store to the other. Try to buy perishable items, such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy and frozen foods, toward the end of your shopping trip to reduce the amount of time they spend at room temperature.

Many stores offer disinfectant wipes to clean your hands and wipe down cart and basket handles before shopping, or you can use your own personal hand sanitizer. And remember to wash your hands when you return from your grocery trip and to put the perishable foods in the refrigerator or freezer right away.

For family or friends that are unable to leave their homes to shop for themselves, ask if food or meal delivery is an option or offer to shop for them.

Can COVID-19 live on fresh fruits and vegetables or food packaging?

According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, theCenters for Disease Control and Preventionand theU.S. Department of Agriculture, there is currently no evidence to suggest that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food or food packaging. It is believed that the virus spreads from person-to-person through close contact or respiratory droplets, for instance when a person coughs or sneezes. However, it may be possible for viruses to survive on surfaces and objects, reinforcing the need to observeproper hygiene and food safety practices.

Fruits and vegetables, even if their peel will not be eaten, should be rinsed under running water and dried with a clean cloth or paper towel. It is recommended that firm produce, such as melons or cucumbers, be scrubbed with a clean produce brush. Soap, bleach or commercial cleaning products should never be used whenwashing fresh produce.

Regular handwashing, along with routine cleaning and disinfecting, especially all frequently touched surfaces, remain the most effective ways to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Get more tips on running essential errands, like going to the grocery store, from theCDC.",planning

Vegetarian children develop normally and are able to meet nutritional needs when their diets are planned appropriately. Nearly all foods — including vegetables — contain a small amount of protein. Build meals around theseplant-based foodsthat contain protein and are rich in nutrients.

Tofu and Tempeh

Tofu and tempeh pack protein and antioxidants. And some are fortified with calcium. Use the texture of tofu as a guide to help you incorporate it into dishes. Add smooth silken tofu to smoothies, soups, puddings and dips. Soft tofu resembles ricotta cheese or scrambled eggs and is best incorporated into rice, pastas or in sandwiches. Bake nuggets from extra-firm tofu or cube it and sauté with stir-fry vegetables. Tempeh is made from fermented soybeans, and its texture resembles extra-firm tofu and can be used in a similar way. For extra flavor, marinate tofu and tempeh in a flavorful sauce in the refrigerator a few hours before cooking.

Beans, Peas and Lentils

Beans, peas and lentils offer protein, fiber, folate, potassium and magnesium, and preparation is simple. Lentils cook in 20 to 30 minutes, while soaking dried beans for 4 hours or overnight is recommended. Discard the soaking water and simmer beans in fresh water for 60 to 90 minutes. Refrigerate cooked beans and use within four days or freeze for three months. Canned beans and lentils are a convenient option. If  “no salt added” cans are unavailable, drain and rinse beans thoroughly to remove almost half the sodium.

Beans, peas and lentils come in many types and colors, making it fun to experiment. Create a chart with your child and cook a new variety each week, and have them draw a smiley face next to their favorites. There are so many types of beans, peas and lentils to choose from! Some varieties include moong beans, black-eyed peas, red lentils or split red lentils, adzuki beans, kidney beans, black beans, pinto beans, fava beans, chickpeas, cowpeas and butter beans.

Add beans to soups, salsa, rice and salads. Make bean enchiladas or quesadillas or use refried beans to make burritos, tostadas or molletes. Add to grilled cheese sandwiches, scoop with corn chips, or puree into dips or baked goods including cookies or brownies. Use peas to make samosa; fava beans to makeful mudammas; soybeans to make natto; mashed peas to makemukimo; and red beans to make red beans and rice. Roast chickpeas in the oven for a crunchy snack!

Nuts and Nut Butters

Parents often ask what nuts are healthiest, but in reality, they all are — providing protein, healthy fats, selenium and vitamin E. Try raw unsalted nuts and natural nut butters without added salt, sugar or oils. Combining nuts with foods your child already eats is a good way to get the benefits of nuts. Offer nuts with fruit for a balanced snack, or pack a handful with your child's favorite crackers or dried fruit to go. Pistachios are fun to shell; walnuts, cashews and pine nuts are soft; almonds and pecans are naturally sweet. For breakfast, chopped nuts can be added as an extra ingredient to muffins and breads, or used as a finishing touch when sprinkled on top of pancakes, oatmeal or low-sugar breakfast cereal. Add to salads, rice and quinoa. Nut butters also taste good when added to oatmeal and smoothies.",food-groups
What to Do During a Food Recall,https://www.eatright.org/food/home-food-safety/safe-food-storage/what-to-do-during-a-food-recall,"Contributors:Sarah Klemm, RDN, CD, LDNPublished:March 28, 2025
Published:March 28, 2025","If there are times when it seems a food recall is constantly in the news, that’s partly thanks to the continuous monitoring that happens to make sure food stays safe. The systems that are used to identify potential problems have gotten more efficient.

While there are a few reasons a food may be recalled, the good news is, there are ways to stay informed and reduce your risk of getting sick from certain foods.

Why is Food Recalled?

Food recalls are typically issued by food producers. This may happen if a food is mislabeled, if they believe the food is contaminated or when a food has been linked to a foodborne illness. Some examples might include undeclared tree nuts found in ice cream, elevated levels of lead in applesauce or potential botulism in canned food.

A foodborne illness outbreak happens when at least two people get the same illness from the same type of food or drink. Some examples includeListeriain a specific brand of cheese,Salmonellain eggs, orE. Coliin carrots. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local health agencies monitor and investigate these situations to help prevent additional people from getting sick.

Public health advisories are issued for recalls and outbreaks when there are specific steps consumers should take to protect themselves. These advisories include information on how to identify products affected and suggestions for handling these foods if you have them at home.

What Should You Do if You Have a Recalled Item?

For a food or beverage recall, specific information is given to help identify the food or beverage affected. This typically includes the type of food, which brands are included and the product’s use-by-date. This information must match for a product to be considered part of the recall. If it doesn't match the recall information, then it is generally considered safe to use.

If a food or beverage is part of a food recall, it should not be consumed. You may be able to return the item for a refund at the place it was purchased. Otherwise, it should be thrown out. This includes any leftovers you may have in the refrigerator or freezer that used the recalled products.

If you identify a food in your home that was part of a food recall, make sure to clean any of the surfaces it may have touched during storage. This includes food storage containers, as well asrefrigeratoror freezer shelves.

Food Safety for High-Risk Groups

While anyone can become sick from a foodborne illness, some groups of people are at a higher risk of serious side effects if they consume food that has these harmful bacteria or viruses. Individuals who are pregnant, children, older adults, and people with cancer, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, organ transplants or autoimmune disorders are all at increased risk.

These individuals are often advised to avoid certainhigh-risk foods, including:

Raw (unpasteurized) milk or cheese

Undercooked or raw eggs, meat and fish

Hot dogs and lunch meats

Raw sprouts

Premade deli salads, such as ham, egg or tuna salads

Safer alternatives to these foods include pasteurized dairy products, eggs and meat cooked to their appropriate internal temperature, deli meats heated to steaming and deli salads made at home. Italsois advisable to wash fruits and vegetables before cooking or eating.

Stay Informed

For live updates on food recalls and public health advisories, check the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services initiative atFoodSafety.gov.

Other ways to stay informed include brushing up on food safety.  Remember towash your handswhen preparing, serving or eating food and always cook foods to theirappropriate internal temperature. These simple steps can help reduce the spread of foodborne illness.",home-food-safety

Make time to eat with your family using the following tips from registered dietitian nutritionists — the food and nutrition experts!

Quick Guide to Nutritious Meals

Planning saves time and allows the opportunity to pack a family meal with an extra nutritional punch. Before you make your shopping list and head to the grocery store, consider the following criteria for healthier options:

Include at least one selection from each of the five food groups: grains, vegetables, fruits, dairy and protein foods.

Incorporate sources of dietary fiber such as whole-grain breads and cereals, and plant-based sources of protein like, beans, nuts and seeds.

Limit foods that are fried or high in added sugar and salt.

Here is a balanced and nutritious dinner: Mediterranean chicken breast (a boneless, skinless chicken breast baked for 20 minutes with lemon juice, a pinch of oregano and topped with feta cheese); steamed broccoli; brown rice; low-fat vanilla yogurt topped with fresh berries; and a glass of water.

Make Meals a Family Affair

Even if in a rush, families still can work together for speedy meal preparation: adults can be in charge of the entrée, older kids can prepare a salad and little ones can help set the table.

Finally, to make the most of your family meals, make conversation part of the dining experience and reduce distractions by turning off the TV and phones and tuning into your loved ones.

What to Serve When You Don’t Have Time for Homemade

If you don't have time to whip up a homemade meal, you still can enjoy all the benefits of a nutritious family dinner. Here are four speedy meals you can prepare without breaking a sweat.

Frozen ravioli with store-bought sauce and a salad. A well-stocked pantry and freezer can go a long way in cutting down on last minute trips to the supermarket. Fill your pantry with go-to ingredients such as your favorite tomato-based pasta sauce, whole-wheat pasta and polenta, and load your freezer with different varieties of frozen ravioli, stuffed shells or manicotti. A healthful dinner will never be more than 20 minutes away.

Rotisserie chicken, frozen mashed potatoes and peas.When it comes to frozen veggies, you can lose the guilt. Because they're flash frozen within hours of harvesting, frozen vegetables actually may have more nutrients than fresh which can sit at the store for days. Plus, they're ready in the microwave or on the stovetop in minutes. In addition to peas, load up on edamame, carrots, corn, chopped spinach and even mashed potatoes.

Veggie burgers with a cucumber salad. A vegetarian meal doesn't have to mean hours over the stove. Keep staples such as veggie burgers and whole-wheat buns on hand for a meatless meal you can throw together on the fly. Serve with sliced cucumbers drizzled with your favorite vinaigrette dressing.

Grilled chicken Caesar salad with French bread.For a convenience meal that feels homemade, slice store-bought grilled chicken breasts and toss with hearts of romaine and light Caesar dressing. If you have a few minutes to spare, bake frozen whole-wheat dinner rolls or French bread and the house will smell like you've been baking all afternoon.",food-preparation

Serve Up the Green

Use the green theme of St. Patrick's Day to get kids interested in eating green produce, which is packed with all kinds of nutrients. Try these delicious options:

Leprechaun Dip: Make an edamame dip that is not only green, but also contains protein, vitamins and minerals. Puree steamed and shelled edamame with olive oil, lime juice and cilantro. Serve with crisp green vegetables, such as cucumber slices, green bell pepper or snap peas.

Shamrocks: Cut green bell peppers crosswise near the pointed end to make Shamrock-shaped slices. Or, make ""Shamrock Mini Pizzas"" by spreading pizza sauce and cheese over split English muffins. Place one bell pepper slice on each mini pizza, and bake until the cheese melts.

Cabbage and corned beef: Make the veggie the focus by giving this classic dish a modern twist. Shred raw cabbage, add grated carrots and toss the mixture with a dash of salt and a tablespoon of sugar. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Drain any water that forms in the dish and toss the cabbage with a bit of vinegar. Sprinkle diced corned beef or bacon bits on top for a veggie-centered corned beef dish.

Celtic pasta with peas: For a meatless main dish, toss cooked whole-grain pasta with pesto and green peas.

Embrace Ireland’s Favorite Veggie

Potatoes contain vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber. Experience Ireland’s passion for potatoes on this holiday:

Potato soup: Make a potato soup lower in fat and higher in protein by substituting fat-free evaporated milk for heavy cream. This keeps the creaminess of the comforting dish while reducing the saturated fat.

Baby boiled potatoes: Put garlic cloves, bay leaf and a pinch of salt in a pot of water. Drop in the baby potatoes and boil until soft. Toss with olive oil and chopped parsley or rosemary. Cut each potato in half and spear with a toothpick.

Sprout 'n potatoes: Cut baby potatoes and Brussels sprouts in half. Toss in olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Broil until lightly brown. Serve on skewers, alternating potato and sprout.

Mashed potatoes: Whip up creamy mashed potatoes using low-fat milk, Greek yogurt or light sour cream and chives. Serve as a side dish or use as a topping for a traditional Shepherd's Pie prepared with lean ground beef or turkey.

Serve a Pot 'o Gold for Dessert

Pot 'o Gold: Make fruit skewers with green grapes and kiwi slices. Place a pineapple chunk at each end to serve as the ""pot 'o gold.""

Apple pie smoothie: Blend a little bit of baby spinach, Greek yogurt and green apples. Mix in apple pie spice. Serve in 4-ounce portions.

Reviewed:November 06, 2024","A member of the rose family, pears are delicious in both sweet and savory dishes, and can be enjoyed raw, stewed, sautéed, baked, roasted, poached and grilled. Their high pectin content makes pears ideal for jams and spreads.

Nutritionally Speaking

Often compared nutritionally to apples, pears hold their own. At about 100 calories, one medium pear delivers 5.5 grams of dietary fiber and 8% of the Daily Value of vitamin C.

Few studies have specifically examined consuming pears and health outcomes. Most research has grouped apples and pears together since they are similar in nutrient composition. Studies looking at pear and apple consumption have indicated there may be an association with lowered risk of diabetes and stroke.

Growing

The Pacific Northwest produces more than 80% of the nation’s pears.

Availability

While peak pear season is during the fall and winter months, many varieties are available throughout the year.

Purchasing

Pears can be purchased fresh or canned. Pears don’t ripen on the tree, so the pears you buy at the grocery store need to be left at room temperature to ripen and reach peak flavor. Don’t buy pears that are soft anywhere but the neck of the pear (a yield to gentle pressure at the neck, where the stem attaches to the fruit, means the pear is ripe). Pears that are soft anywhere else means they are overripe and mushy. If you plan to eat a pear in a few days, choose one with a neck that is hard.

Storing

Don’t refrigerate unripe pears — they only ripen at room temperature. If you want to speed up ripening, place pears in a paper bag with a ripe banana or apple. These fruits give off ethylene gas, which the pears absorb and then produce on their own, speeding up the ripening process.

Once ripe, pears can be refrigerated until you’re ready to use them. But be aware that while refrigeration will delay further ripening, it won’t stop it completely. Since fresh pears tend to absorb odors, store them away from foods like onions.

Preparing

A ripe pear is delicious on its own or used in recipes. As with other fruits, the flesh of peeled or cut pears will eventually brown, although this natural oxidation won’t change the pear’s quality or taste. To prevent browning, dip cut pears in a solution of half water and half lemon juice, or sprinkle with a commercial citric acid powder.

Using

Anjou pears are the most abundant and can be green with a sweet, almost citrus flavor, or red with a sweeter, slightly spicy flavor. Enjoy Anjou pears fresh, as a chutney or in pie. Available almost year-round, Bartletts deliver classic pear flavor and are great for canning or puréeing. The firm texture and bold flavor of Bosc pears make them best for poaching or baking. Luscious Comice pears are coveted for their creamy texture, succulent sweetness and exceptional juiciness. Also known as the Christmas pear, Comices are best eaten raw, especially paired with cheese. Sweet, petite Seckels are perfect pears for snacking and make an adorable addition to lunch boxes.

Flavors that complement this versatile fruit include warm spices such as allspice, ginger, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg; nuts such as pistachios, almonds and pecans; and dark chocolate.

Pear butter or spiced pear muffins are breakfast favorites. Poach fresh whole pears in wine for a simple dessert or make a pear tart. Use a food processor to julienne pears for a crunchy slaw. Pears also go well with greens; toss them with bitter endive or try a roasted pear, Gorgonzola and pecan salad.

If you end up with too many overripe pears, you can still use them. Blend them into smoothies or sauces. You can freeze pureed pears for future use, too.

While common food allergens lurk in many traditional dishes served at Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, Christmas and Kwanzaa celebrations, a little preparation and planning can help you — whether you're a parent of a child with food allergies or hosting guests who have them — glide through the holidays safely.

These tips can help you navigate food allergies safely and healthfully this holiday season.

5 Tips for Avoiding Food Allergens at Home

Host at your home.Because you are in control of what is served, this can be the safest option when managing food allergies. You may choose to prepare only ""safe"" foods and let guests know what they can and cannot bring into the house. If you do have foods containing allergens, designate separate areas for these foods to be served to help prevent cross-contact.

Focus on whole, unprocessed foods.While cooking from scratch may seem like more work, it helps ensure food and prep areas are free from food allergens. You might even find that you save time in the long run because you don't have to scour every ingredient list.

Modify traditional recipes using allergen-free ingredients.Once you know a few simple swaps, you may realize just how easy it is to modify your recipes. Focus on similar items when considering swaps, like non-dairy milk for cow's milk (or vice-versa), or naturally gluten-free grains for wheat. Eggs in recipes often can be substituted with ground, rehydrated flax or chia seeds.

Alwaysread all ingredient labels.Even if you think a product is allergen-free, read the label. Food manufacturers change formulas, which may introduce allergens into previously ""safe"" foods and beverages.

Keep it clean.Prevent cross-contact and cross-contamination by encouraging frequent handwashing.

3 Tips for Avoiding Food Allergens Away from Home

Offer to help the host.If you help plan the menu or shop for ingredients, you can choose items you know are safe. If you cook, you can help ensure that dishes are prepared without allergens. And, don't hesitate to ask your host to save labels from products to reference and provide you peace of mind.

Bring snacks and desserts.If helping ahead of time is out of the question, bring a few allergen-free options. Bring your own allergen-free snacks and desserts, since baked goods feature common allergens such as wheat, dairy, eggs, nuts and soy. Pack snacks such as fresh fruit with sunflower butter packets, carrots with hummus, popcorn and homemade trail mix made with rice cereal, seeds and chocolate chips. For easy festive desserts, melt chocolate chips as a dip for dried apricots or allergen-free cookies, or bake apples sprinkled with cinnamon and brown sugar and top with allergen-free whipped topping.

Communication is key.If a host is unfamiliar with how to handle food allergies, they might fall victim to the ""a little bit won't hurt"" mindset. Communicate at the start that a little bitcanhurt, and that you'd be more than happy to help with shopping or prep so that the host can feel comfortable and you can feel confident in the foods served.",cultural-cuisines-and-traditions

Adults decide what foods and beverages are served. Plus, they choose where to serve the meal and make mealtimes pleasant.

Children decide whether to eat and how much to eat. As they get older, they can learn age-appropriate table manners and mealtime behaviors.

Make It Better

If you have picky eaters in your family, you already know the signs of when they dislike a meal: a blank stare, a turned-up nose, the plate pushed away. Instead of getting upset with their pickiness and falling into familiar mealtime battles, try a new tactic. Ask: ""How can I make that better for you?""

This question seems simple, but it can work like magic to open lines of communication between you and your children, and can give kids a feeling of control to make the meal more enjoyable. It also may take the pressure off you, since you won't have to guess what they want — which changes frequently.

Phrasing is key. Instead of a negative question — such as, ""Why don't you like it?"" — a positive question allows for constructive problem-solving and innovative solutions that you create as a team.

The first time you ask, ""How can I make that better for you?"" your child may not know how to answer. That's OK. Here are some common complaints and suggested solutions (note that whole and chopped nuts and seeds are choking hazards for children under 4):

""The food is too hot.""Put the plate in the fridge for a few minutes or add ice to hot soup.

""The food is too cold.""A quick zap in the microwave or a few minutes under the broiler will help.

""The food is plain.""Add pizzazz to plates with ""sprinkles"": flax seeds, sesame seeds, slivered almonds, fresh mint, shredded coconut, nutritional yeast, cinnamon or shredded Parmesan or cheddar cheese.

""The food is boring.""Add a dip such hummus, guacamole, mild salsa or a yogurt-based tzatziki. A dollop of dip adds flavor and fun.

""The food is too crunchy.""Lightly steam vegetables or add a sauce or spread to crackers or toast.

""The food is too creamy.""Add texture to soup or yogurt with nuts, seeds, panko breadcrumbs, croutons, granola, diced vegetables or fruit.

""The plate has [fill in the blank] on it, and I don't like it.""Something as simple as a speck of green herbs or a bit of diced red pepper can be enough to ruin an entire dish for a child. Give your child permission to put the offending food to the side of the plate.

Be warned: The solution that works today may not work tomorrow. The answer to ""How can I make that better for you?"" will often change but it will always lead to some answer. Whether it's a sprinkle of cheese or removing the ""green stuff,"" a simple question can save you from troublesome mealtimes and ensure everyone enjoys what they are eating.

6 More Ways to Have Meals without Squeals

Make Regularly Scheduled Meals a Family Priority.Young children need the reassurance of structured meal and snack times. Eating on the run can be sufficient for adults, but it doesn't work well for children. Whether you are eating at home or at a restaurant, take time to sit down and eat with your child.

Avoid Pressuring or Forcing Children to Eat.Most adults have good intentions when they try to make children eat ""healthy"" foods or try new items. The problem with pressure is it doesn't work. Kids like foods less if they are forced to eat them.

Model the Habits You Want Children to Develop.Young children do not automatically know how to eat like adults. They learn how to behave at the table by watching their most important role model, you, for developing lifelong, healthy eating habits.

Enjoy the Foods You Want Your Children to Enjoy.Children learn to eat new foods by watching other people eat and enjoy them. If you want a child to eat green vegetables, you eat green vegetables. Serve them regularly in a variety of appealing ways. Talk about how good they taste and how they make you strong and smart.

Create a Relaxed Atmosphere for Mealtimes.The best family meals have minimal distractions. This means turning off the TV and handheld devices. Music can provide a pleasant background for meals if it is played at low volume and doesn't drown out conversation.

Have Realistic Expectations for Mealtime Behavior.It takes time for children to master new skills, which includes table manners. Adults need to lay out clear expectations for mealtime behaviors and reinforce appropriate behaviors.",planning

Washing is one of the primary ways to reduce risk of food poisoning. From hands to kitchen counters, it is important to wash properly to stop the spread of harmful bacteria and viruses. However, when it comes to food, the rules of washing are not as clear. There are some foods that should always be washed — and others that should be kept far away from the sink.

Always Wash

Fruits and Vegetables with Edible Peels:Wash all produce — no matter if it is organic or conventionally grown — with cool tap water immediately before eating or using in a recipe. Skip the soap because the porous surfaces of fresh produce can absorb the ingredients in soap. Dry with a clean cloth or paper towel to further reduce the harmful bacteria that may be present on the surface of fresh produce.Misting produce at the grocery store does not clean it.

Fruits and Vegetables with Inedible Peels:Bananas, avocados, grapefruit, lemons, limes and winter squash — what do all of these have in common? You guessed it, inedible peels. Wash all produce, even if the peel will not be eaten, because dirt and bacteria can be transferred from the peel to the inside of the food as it is sliced or peeled.

Can and Jar Lids:Wash lids before opening them so harmful particles don't fall into food. Be sure to wash all cans before opening, including canned beverages and soup.

Don't Wash

Raw Chicken (and Other Raw Meat):Despite what many think, washing raw chicken does not clean it. In fact, rinsing raw chicken may spread harmful bacteria such asSalmonellaorCampylobacteraround the kitchen, which can potentially make you sick. The only way to kill those pathogens is to cook chicken and other meats to their appropriate  internal temperature.

Fish:Avoid washing raw fish because it doesn't clean the fish. Instead, it increases the chance of cross-contamination to other foods, utensils and surfaces.

Eggs:Avoid washing eggs after purchase because it can remove the coating that protects eggs from bacteria that is applied during processing.",home-food-safety

Summer's bounty of tomatoes and peaches may be over, but harvest season has its own advantages such as an abundance of the following delicious fall foods. Here are some simple, kid-friendly ways to add them to your family's meals.

Pumpkin

Is anything more fall-like than a pumpkin? These famously orange winter squashes are chock-full of vitamin A and deliver 3 grams of fiber per ½-cup serving of cooked sugar pumpkin, plus they contribute toward potassium needs. Note that the pumpkins you carve into jack-o’-lanterns are not the same type of pumpkins you eat. Try pumpkin puree mixed into mac-and-cheese or with hummus for a seasonal spread. Looking for more options? Add pumpkin to pancake batter, oatmeal, smoothies or your kid's favorite chili.

And don't forget about roasting the seeds! Pumpkin seeds are a delicious and healthful snack and a source of several nutrients, including zinc, which is essential for many body processes including immune function.

To toast your pumpkin seeds, first rinse to remove pulp and strings. Spread seeds on a baking sheet that has been coated with cooking spray or drizzle a small amount of olive oil over seeds. Bake at 325°F for about 30 minutes or until lightly toasted. Stir occasionally during cooking. Take a look at your spice rack and try a seasoning on your toasted seeds such as garlic powder or Cajun seasoning.

Oats

Heart-healthy, oats are a good source of dietary fiber for slow-burning energy.Warm oatmeal is an affordable and filling breakfast. Top oatmeal with nuts such as walnuts, almonds or pecans, seeds such as ground flaxseed or pumpkin seeds and fruit such as pears or cranberries for even more fiber, vitamins and minerals.

Apples

Apples pack a powerful nutrition punch and are a source of vitamin C and dietary fiber — eat the skins for the full fiber benefits.

Sprinkle apple slices with ground cinnamon or pair with cheese or peanut butter for an easy snack. Don't forget about dinner! Apples taste great when stewed and served with savory foods such as roasted pork.

Brussels Sprouts

They may be small, but Brussels sprouts are part of the powerhouse cruciferous veggie family. Each 1-cup serving of cooked Brussels sprouts provides 4 grams of dietary fiber, is an excellent source of vitamins A, C, K and folate and a good source of iron. They even have some protein.

You can cut whole Brussels sprouts into kid-friendly quarters and toss with sea salt and olive oil and roast until crispy. If your kids are skeptical, serve the sprouts mixed with roasted sweet potato or butternut squash cubes. You also can shred them (or buy them pre-shredded) and sauté lightly in olive oil then toss with your kids’ favorite pasta or rice dish.",food-preparation

For young children, the meals may be small, but there are big lessons to learn about lifelong healthy dining habits.

Choose Kid-Friendly Restaurants

Choose a restaurant that caters to children and has a nutritious children's menu that includes smaller portion sizes and meals designed to provide ample nourishment for smaller bodies. Many restaurants have menus available online so you can check out the options in advance.

Fruit First

Depending on the age of the children — whether they need mashed bananas or are fine with finger foods — ask for cut up fruit while you enjoy an appetizer. It will keep them occupied and contribute to the one cup of fruit they need per day.

Go Small

To prevent choking, cut grapes and other solid foods, such as meat, poultry, bread and veggies into tiny bites.

Table Lessons

Teach kids to slow down and savor flavors. Parents are powerful role models so set a positive example by setting a relaxed pace. Dining out with small children helps encourage a healthy curiosity about food and how to behave at the table.

Pass the Pasta Please

The old stand-by plate of pasta is a kid favorite. Penne, macaroni or shells are easiest for small children to maneuver onto a spoon. Ask for pasta with a little olive oil or marinara sauce.

Simple is Best

Often side dishes, even steamed vegetables, are highly seasoned. Request that a child's vegetables be made without added salt. Order a plain baked potato or sweet potato, mash and season lightly at the table.

Beware the Hot Stuff

Kids move fast. Be mindful that hot foods can hurt little mouths. Avoid spicy foods as well. It's always best if you taste a child's food first.

Try New Foods, Too!

Some kids are more adventurous than others but it's important to encourage tasting new foods when dining out. The more variety in the diet, the more nutrients provided. Choose two or three suitable menu items, then let your child pick one. For new foods, offer a bite or two from your meal or order plain foods with the sauce on the side.

Learn to Share

Whether it's splitting a platter of pasta for the whole family to sample or ordering one slice of cheesecake with four forks; dining out teaches proper portion control when you share.

Rethink the Sweets

Dining out used to be a special occasion so soda was an acceptable treat. But, since most kids dine out multiple times per week,think about the drinks. Encourage fat-free milk, plain water or make your own special ""soda"" by squeezing lemon into sparkling water.",planning

Unfortunately, most children don't get enough fruits and vegetables throughout the day. Here are some ideas on how to make meals nutritious and delicious by incorporating produce in fun and interesting ways that kids will enjoy.

Fill Half the Plate with Fruits and Vegetables

Encourage kids to consume more of these nutritional powerhouses by making produce the star of the meal. Dish out generous helpings and always include options that your family enjoys. Serve vegetables in a variety of ways to give your child an opportunity to explore the tastes, textures and aromas. In addition, since many raw vegetables require extra chewing, they may make children slow down and, in turn, eat more mindfully.

Take Fruit to Lunch

Fruit is a great way to add a little sweetness to a meal. Make a habit of tucking an apple, tangerine, melon slices, plums, kiwifruit, grapes, cherries or dried fruits into lunch bags.

Stuff Sandwiches with Fruits and Vegetables

Create a sandwich bar with whole-grain breads, wraps and rolls, various lean meats, low-fat cheese, sliced tomato, bell pepper rings, cucumber slices, lettuce, marinated artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, sliced avocado, hummus and mustard. Or, for those who love peanut butter and other nut or seed butters, try adding berries or sliced fruit such as apples and bananas in place of jam or jelly.

Experiment to Try New Flavors and Textures

Substitute a new-to-you fruit or vegetable in a favorite recipe. Try mustard greens in stir-fries, jicama in salad or plantains in stew. You also can encourage your children to pick out a new fruit or vegetable at the grocery store or farmers market to help them try new flavors.

Toss a Fruit and Vegetable Salad

Combine colorful vegetables, legumes and fruits (such as berries, kiwifruit or mandarin oranges). Different types of lettuce pair well with a variety of nutrient-dense veggies — sliced beets, bell peppers, shredded red cabbage, spinach leaves, baby carrots and more.

Try Veggies at Breakfast

Fill omelets with a rainbow of diced vegetables, create a colorful tofu scramble with your favorite veggies or serve toast topped with avocado, white beans and cooked mushrooms.

Incorporate Veggies into Other Foods

If your children prefer to push peas around the plate instead of eating them, you've probably considered sneaking a few veggies into their favorite foods. And while a little stealth nutrition can help children eat more vegetables, it shouldn't be your only strategy. If you're always hiding vegetables, how will your family get to know and enjoy them? By offering your family a variety of options they will be more likely to grow into true vegetable lovers.

You don't need to hide vegetables on a regular basis. However, if you have a picky eater who doesn't like vegetables, disguising them a little can be a helpful way to get more produce into their diet. When it comes to getting children to happily eat veggies, the more alternatives the better. So go ahead and fold mushrooms into meatloaf and shred carrots into spaghetti sauce.

Using vegetables as an ingredient, rather than the main attraction, is an easy way to give veggies more face time without making it overwhelming. Top pizza with onions and peppers, sprinkle tomatoes and avocados on tacos or fold butternut squash into mac and cheese.

Mix it Up

Eating the same old plate of steamed vegetables each day would be boring for anyone, so be sure to keep it interesting and varied. For instance, just because your family doesn't enjoy roasted vegetables doesn't mean they won't love them sautéed with garlic. Get creative and try different cooking methods, herbs and spices or try offering veggies raw with dip or in a crunchy salad.

If these efforts don't immediately boost your children's fruit and vegetable intake, take heart and be patient. Simply continue to make fruits and veggies a part of every meal and snack and offer them in a variety of ways. Eventually your children will develop a taste for a few favorites.",planning

Whether you are new to the kitchen or just need a refresher, understanding the basics of common cooking techniques will help you navigate through recipes and get healthy meals on the table with ease. From slicing to steaming, here's how to talk the talk in the kitchen.

The B, C and Ds of Cooking

Bake:type of dry heat cooking —food is cooked using the hot air surrounding it, usually in an oven

Barbecue (grill):type of dry heat cooking — to roast or broil food over a source of heat like charcoal or hardwood fire

Boil:type of moist heat cooking — a liquid is brought to a boil and food is cooked in it

Braise:to brown, then simmer slowly over low heat in a small amount of liquid in a covered pot, on the stove or in the oven

Broil:to cook using a direct heat source, usually under a heating element in the oven, but it also can be done over the flame of a grill

Chop:cut food into smaller pieces of no particular size or shape

Dice:cut foods into uniform square pieces

Deep-fry:type of dry heat cooking — cook food by submerging it in hot oil

Dry heat cooking:methods that use hot air, the heat from a pan or grill, or hot fat to cook foods

From G to Ps & Qs

Grate:to create small (fine or coarsely shredded) pieces by rubbing food against a serrated surface

Mince:cut food into very small pieces

Moist heat cooking:methods that use water or liquids such as broth to cook foods

Panbroil:to cook uncovered in a preheated, skillet without added fat or water

Poach:type of moist heat cooking — to cook gently in simmering liquid

Quadriller:to make a crisscross pattern on the outside of grilled or broiled food

R to Z

Roast:type of dry heat cooking — to cook uncovered with dry heat in the oven or in a fire

Sauté:type of dry heat cooking — to cook quickly in a small amount of fat

Simmer:type of moist heat cooking — cooking food in a hot liquid that is bubbling but not boiling

Slice:to cut through or across into slices, generally of uniform size

Steam:type of moist heat cooking — to cook a food over boiling water with the steam heat, or wrapped in foil or leaf (such as banana leaves) packets over boiling water or on a grill

Stew:to cook in a liquid, in a tightly covered pot over low heat

Stir-fry:to cook small pieces of food over high heat, stirring continuously — generally with only a small amount of oil

Zest:to scrape the outer rind of a piece of citrus fruit for flavoring

Be in the Know

Knowing these culinary techniques can help to bring out the flavor of foods without adding a lot of extra ingredients or calories. The healthiest cooking methods require only a little amount of fat:

Sautéing and stir-frying use a small amount of oil, compared with frying or deep-frying.

Steaming helps foods retain more nutrients, since they are not soaking in water, as is the case with boiling.

Grilling also can influence the flavor of foods, but it's important to avoid charring them, which occurs when foods turn black.

Marinating meats and vegetables prior to grilling can help add flavor and keep them moist.

And, remember, cooking all foods to the appropriate internal temperatures is important, regardless of how the food is prepared!",food-preparation

When you're relaxing with family and friends, it's easy to get caught up in the fun and overlook food safety. Unfortunately, one small error can sicken your whole crew, making you one unpopular host! In fact, one in six Americans gets sick every year from foodborne pathogens. Reduce your odds of foodborne illness by avoiding these seven common picnic food slip-ups.

Picnic Error: You Didn't Wash Your Hands

A large percentage of foodborne illnesses could be avoided if people washed their hands more often when preparing food.Wash your handsbefore cooking, after handling raw meat and before preparing or serving food. Bring hand sanitizer if there is no running water at your picnic site, and rub it all over your hands, including between fingers and around nails.

Picnic Error: You Didn't Start with a Clean Slate

Your hands aren't the only things you should keep clean. If you're not careful, juices from raw meat and poultry can drip into your cooler, creating a breeding ground for bacteria. Before you pack for a picnic, sanitize your cooler and wash reusable bags for transporting food. Pack food in clean, tightly sealed containers.

If you won't have access to running water at your picnic site, wash fruits and vegetables at home first. Wash produce even if you plan on peeling it; bacteria can transfer from the knife or peeler to the edible portion.

Picnic Error: You Cross-Contaminated

If you won't be able to wash plates, tongs and serving utensils at the picnic site, bring two sets: one for handling raw meats and one for serving cooked foods. Accidentally serving cooked hamburgers on the same plate you used for the raw patties can lead to foodborne illness. Make sure you keep ready-to-eat food such as buns, fruits, vegetables and side dishes away from contaminated serving utensils, too.

Also, don't repurpose marinade used on raw meat, seafood or poultry unless it’s been boiled before going onto ready-to-eat or cooked food. Lastly, pack your cooler with care. As much as possible, separate fruits, vegetables and cooked foods from raw meat, poultry and seafood.

Picnic Error: Your Cooler Lost its Cool

Even an insulated cooler can't keep food cool enough on its own.Pack your coolerabout three quarters of the way full of food, reserving one quarter of the space for ice packs. Chill or freeze foods and beverages before packing them in your cooler. Pack cold and hot food separately.

Always pack an appliance thermometer in the cooler and keep an eye on it throughout the day, ensuring it doesn't go above 40°F. Consider packing beverages in a separate cooler. You can keep the cooler with perishable food closed while the beverage cooler is frequently opened and shut.

Picnic Error: You Repurposed Ice

If you're bringing ice to use in beverages, pack it in a separate sealed bag. Loose ice used to keep food cold should not be used in beverages. This ice can easily pick up bacteria from the surfaces of food containers or other items in the cooler.

Picnic Error: You Didn't Bring a Food Thermometer

Foods that need to be cooked must reach certain temperatures to control harmful bacteria. Hamburgers should be cooked to a minimum internal temperature of 160°F. Chicken breasts and legs must be cooked to at least 165°F.

There are right and wrong ways to take the temperature of meat. For example, you'll get a false reading if the food thermometer touches a bone when you're testing a chicken leg. Hamburgers should always be tested in the thickest section. Here are some other important tips forproperly using a food thermometer, along with minimal internal temperatures for other foods.

Picnic Error: You Let Food Sit Out

Keep perishable food out of thedanger zone— a temperature range between 40°F and 140°F. When food is in the danger zone, bacteria can double in number every 20 minutes. Unfortunately, you cannot see, smell or taste if a food has harmful bacteria or toxins growing in it. Pack food in a well-insulated cooler with plenty of ice or ice packs to keep the temperature below 40°F. Transport the cooler in the back seat of your air-conditioned car instead of in your hot trunk. Remove from the cooler only the amount of food that will fit on the grill.

Don't let food sit out for more than two hours. If the temperature outside is 90°F or above, food should only sit out for an hour at most. It's easy to lose track of time when you're relaxing outside. Bring a timer or set an alarm on your cell phone to remind you when it's time to put food away. Remember — it's not just meat that can make you sick. All perishable food should be monitored closely, especially egg, potato and tuna salads made with mayonnaise, and anything dairy-based.

So, before you pack the picnic basket, remember these simple tips to ensure that unwanted bacteria won't have a place at your table.",planning

Not only is it important to lead by example, vegetables contain dietary fiber, vitamins, minerals and phytonutrients that promote health as we age and help reduce the risk of chronic diseases including heart disease, diabetes and some cancers.

Include a Variety of Veggies

Whether it's for powering through a workout, rounding up the kids to get to school on time or accomplishing a big work project, our lives demand a lot of energy. A balanced eating pattern that includes vegetables from all subgroups can help fuel you throughout the day. This includes vegetables that are dark green, red and orange, starchy, and beans and peas.

Get the Most Nutrition from Veggies

Even though vegetables are a great source of nutrients, water-soluble vitamins such as vitamin C, riboflavin, thiamin and folate can be destroyed by exposure to high temperatures and long cooking times, or lost when cooking water is discarded. To keep the vitamins in your vegetables from escaping:

Leave edible skins on vegetables or trim as little as possible, but be sure to wash them first.

Steam, microwave or stir-fry vegetables instead of boiling to reduce the amount of water and heat they are exposed to.

Cooler temperatures help preserve vitamins, so it is recommended that some produce be stored in the refrigerator.

Looking for veggies high in antioxidants? Include a variety of vegetables from all of the subgroups — dark green, red and orange, beans and peas, as well as starchy vegetables. Try asparagus, beets, broccoli and sweet potatoes. Want the best vitamin C bang for your bite? Try fresh, chopped red bell peppers or cooked broccoli. Just 1 cup of either veggie exceeds your daily minimum requirements of this vitamin.

How Much Do You Need?

Adult men should consume 2½ to 4 cups of veggies daily, but many  fall short of this amount. Aim to include vegetables at most meals and snacks during the day. Try a variety of veggies and experiment with different preparation methods, such as roasting, grilling and steaming. For example, try roasted red peppers and sautéed mushrooms as sandwich fillings and burger toppings. You easily can add ½ cup of vegetables to a sandwich. Using raw spinach in salads and topping off with roasted broccoli or a vegetarian protein, like beans, is another way to pump up the vitamin content.

Think Food First

Multivitamins are supplements, not substitutes for whole foods and vegetables. Important phytonutrients (such as antioxidants) and dietary fiber are two components of vegetables that make them irreplaceable by a pill. Besides, a grilled ear of corn tastes so much better!",food-groups

Proper Planning

Make sure your kitchen is equipped with what you need for safe food handling, including two cutting boards (one for raw meats and seafood and the other for produce and ready-to-eat foods), a food thermometer, shallow containers for storage, paper towels and soap. Store perishable foods in the refrigerator at 40°F or below, or in the freezer at 0°F or below. Check the temperature of both the refrigerator and freezer with an appliance thermometer.

Safe Shopping

It's important to keep food safety in mind as you shop. Keep raw meat, poultry and seafood separate from ready-to-eat foods like fruit, vegetables and bread. Embrace fruits and vegetables that are oddly shaped but don't purchase bruised or damaged produce, or canned goods that are dented, leaking, bulging or rusted, as these may become a breeding ground for harmful bacteria.

When shopping, choose refrigerated and frozen foods last to help prevent them from entering thetemperature danger zonewhere bacteria multiply the fastest, between 40°F to 140°F. Bring foods directly home from the grocery store and always refrigerate perishable foods, such as raw meat or poultry, right away.

Working in the Kitchen

In a holiday kitchen filled with family and friends, all hands may be on deck, but are those hands clean? Make sure everyone washes their hands thoroughly with clean, running water and soap for 20 seconds before and after handling food.

And, when baking delicious holiday treats, remember that no one should eat raw cookie dough or brownie batter. Have children take theCookie Rookie Pledgebefore they assist in the kitchen.

Wrapping Up Leftovers

As you eat and visit, keep in mind how long the food on the buffet table has been sitting out. Remember that you can't tell if a food is unsafe by taste, smell or appearance alone. Throw away perishable foods such as meat, poultry, eggs and casseroles that are left at room temperature longer than two hours and within one hour if it's warmer than 90° F.

Refrigerate or freeze other leftovers in shallow, air-tight containers and label with a date. Use refrigerated leftovers within three to four days by reheating to an internal temperature of 165°F.",cultural-cuisines-and-traditions

A typical breakfast can consist of olives, hummus, vegetables, bread and fresh juices. A fun Israeli recipe to make with school-age kids is skewers with vegetables such as peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, pitted olives and cheese.

Kenya:A traditional Kenyan breakfast includes porridge made from maize (corn), sorghum or millet. It may be served with peanuts or fish and boiled sweet potatoes or cassava.

India:Indian breakfasts often are vegetarian.

One solution is to prepare meals over the weekend and reheat them during the week. The question is, how far in advance can meals be prepared while still being safe to eat?

Quiz:How long do leftovers keep in the refrigerator?

A: One to two days

B: Three to four days

C: One to two weeks

Although one to two weeks may seem like a reasonable response, the answer is B. Most leftovers — such as cooked beef, pork, seafood or chicken, chili, soups, pizza, casseroles and stew — can be safely kept for three to four days. Pasta salads, potato salads, other styles of potatoes and cooked rice will last three to five days, and cooked vegetables last three to four days.

Shop on Saturday. Cook on Sunday.

Planning and then preparing a couple of meals on the weekend provides quick dinners or lunches for the week. Bake chicken breasts or make a tuna casserole. Baked potatoes, rice and even pasta can be made in advance. At dinner time, add a packaged salad or microwave fresh vegetables for a complete meal.

Keep Food at Peak Quality.

When cooking in bulk, don't let food sit in large containers at room temperature to cool before putting them in the refrigerator. Immediately portion into smaller containers and refrigerate. If food is stored in large containers, it takes a while for the food to cool down. During that time, bacteria can grow and make food unsafe to eat.

Reheat Leftovers Properly.

Instead of reheating an entire dish, only reheat portions for that night's meal. After reheating food in the microwave or oven, use a thermometer to ensure leftovers reach a safe internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit.

Cook in Bulk.

If eating the same food day after day gets boring or you made more pasta sauce than you can eat in three to four days, portion into meals and freeze for later. Frozen food will stay safe for a lot longer. Foods that do not freeze well include eggs in the shell, lettuce, cottage cheese and mayonnaise. Foods that do freeze well include soups, casseroles, breads and some vegetables.

When In Doubt, Toss It Out.

Remember, leftovers don't last forever. Obviously, do not eat leftovers that are green and fuzzy or smell like a pair of old sneakers. But what if it's been in the refrigerator for a week and looks fine? Harmful bacteria that can cause foodborne illness cannot be seen or smelled. Err on the side of caution and eat or freeze all leftovers before the three to four day time frame.

Preparing dinners in advance and safely reheating them leaves time in the evening to relax and unwind. Use the extra time to learn a new hobby, read to your kids or go for a walk around the neighborhood.",home-food-safety
7 Ways to Enhance the Flavor of Your Meals,https://www.eatright.org/food/food-preparation/cooking-tips/enhancing-the-flavor-of-your-meals,"Contributors:Sarah Klemm, RDN, CD, LDN

Reviewed:February 22, 2023","Cooking at home can be healthy, rewarding and cost-effective. The foods you enjoy are likely the ones you eat the most often, so make flavor a priority when preparing nutritious, satisfying meals.

To maximize the flavor and nutrition of a food, start with high-quality ingredients, like tender cuts of meat, fresh fruit that’s free of bruises, and frozen vegetables that are free of ice chunks. It's also important to handle and store foods properly. Poor storage can destroy the flavor and quality of food.

Overcooking can also destroy flavor and nutrients. Try gentle cooking techniques like steaming to help retain nutrients, flavor, color.

Try these seven simple techniques to enhance the flavors of food.

Intensify the flavors of meat, poultry and fish with high-heat cooking techniques such as pan-searing, grilling or broiling, which help to brown meat and add flavor. Just don't overcook, burn or char meat.

Roast veggies in a very hot (450°F) oven or grill for a sweet, smoky flavor. Before popping them into the oven, brush or spray lightly with an oil that has a high smoke point and sprinkle with herbs.

Caramelize sliced onions to bring out their natural sweetness by cooking them slowly over low heat in a bit of oil. Use them to make a rich, dark sauce for meat or poultry.

Pep it up with peppers! Use red, green and yellow peppers of all varieties — sweet, hot and dried. Or, add a dash of hot pepper sauce.

Add a tangy taste with citrus juice or grated citrus peel: lemon, lime or orange. Acidic ingredients help lift and balance flavor.

Use small amounts of ingredients with bold flavors such as pomegranate seeds, chipotle pepper or cilantro.

Give a flavor burst with condiments such as horseradish, flavored mustard, chutney, wasabi, bean purees, tapenade and salsas of all kinds.",food-preparation

If you haven't taken a walk on the tropical side, try these four picks.

Mangoes

Mangoes are loaded with vitamin C, a nutrient that helps wounds heal, promotes healthy gums and supports your child's immune system. One cup of sliced mango is an excellent source of vitamin C and a good source of folate and copper. For an afternoon snack, serve mango slices with a pinch of chili powder and a squirt of lime. Or, whip up a batch of mango ice pops. Simply puree fresh, ripe mangoes in a food processor, pour into ice cube trays, insert a wooden stick and freeze for a frosty 100% fruit treat.

Guavas

Guavas provide dietary fiber to help keep your child's digestive system in top shape. Just one medium guava boasts 3 grams of dietary fiber. That's as much as you get from a half cup of raisins or a cup of apple slices with skin on. For an even bigger fiber boost, puree whole guavas with the skin on in shakes, smoothies and juices.

Loquats

For those looking for a citrus fruit, loquats may be a what you crave. Loquats are a citrus similar in size to kumquats. One cup of loquats is a good source of vitamin A.

Papayas

These pink-orange fruits provide vitamin A through beta-carotene for healthy skin and eyes. Fat in a meal or snack increases the amount of beta-carotene the body absorbs, so pairing papaya with avocados and chopped fresh mint in a sweet yet savory salad is nutrition-savvy and delicious. One cup of papaya cubes are an excellent source of vitamin C and are a good source of folate.",food-groups

Pumpkin

Pumpkin is full of dietary fiber and beta-carotene, which provides its vibrant orange color. Beta-carotene converts into vitamin A in the body, which is great for your skin and eyes. To balance pumpkin’s sweetness, try adding savory herbs, such as sage and curry.

Beets

Beets are edible from their leafy greens down to the bulbous root. The leaves are similar to spinach and are delicious sautéed. The grocery store most likely will carry red beets; your local farmers market may have more interesting varieties, such as golden or bull's blood, which has a bullseye pattern of rings. The red color in beets is caused by a phytochemical called betanin, making beet juice a natural alternative to red food coloring. Beets are a source of naturally occurring nitrates and may help to support healthy blood pressure. Roasting or steaming beets whole takes the fuss out of peeling — the skin easily slides off after cooking. They also are delicious raw, shredded and tossed in salads or thinly sliced and baked into chips.

Sweet Potato

Sweet potatoes are full of dietary fiber and vitamin A. They also are a good source of potassium and vitamin C. Try them as a breakfast side dish, or serve them at any meal.

Spaghetti Squash

Spaghetti squash is a fun, kid-friendly vegetable that is a lower-calorie and gluten-free alternative to grain-based pasta. Cut one in half to reveal a pocket of seeds; scoop those out and pop the two halves into the microwave or oven and cook until tender. Scrape a fork into the flesh and spaghetti-like strands appear! Voilà! Toss with pesto or marinara sauce for a quick veggie side dish.

Kale

We can't get enough of this luscious leafy green and with good reason: Kale is a nutrient powerhouse. It tastes sweeter after a frost and can survive a snowstorm. If you plant kale in your garden, you can dig it out of the snow and serve fresh salad in January. One cup of raw kale has only 8 calories and is loaded with vitamins A, C and K, as well as manganese. Kale is great sautéed and cooked in soup, but also is excellent raw in salad; simply remove tough stems, slice into thin slivers and pair with something a bit sweet such as carrots or apples. One advantage of using kale for your leafy greens is that you can add dressing ahead of time; kale becomes more tender and delicious, not wilted.

Pears

When we can buy fruits year-round, we tend to forget they have seasons. Pears are the most delicious in the fall when they're at their peak. Pears are unique in that they do not ripen on the tree; they will ripen at room temperature after they're picked. How do you know when they are ready to eat? Check the neck! If the fruit near the stem gives to a little pressure, it is ripe. There are a wide range of pear flavors and textures. And, just like apples, some are excellent eaten fresh while others are best cooked or canned for the winter. Try pears on the grill, poached in red wine, tucked into a panini, pureed into soup or a smoothie, or simply sliced with cheese. If you eat the peel too, one medium pear has 6 grams of dietary fiber.

Okra

Okra commonly is fried, but also is wonderful in other forms. Around the world, chefs cherish the thickening properties of the seed pods in dishes from Louisiana gumbo to Indian curries and other stews. If you wish to minimize the thickening property, try okra briefly stir-fried. The pods are high in vitamins K and C, a good source of fiber, an excellent source of folate and low in calories. At the market, look for pods that are no longer than 4 inches and are bright green in color and firm to the touch.

Parsnips

Parsnips are cousins to carrots — they have the same root shape but with white flesh. They're typically eaten cooked, but also can be eaten raw. One-half cup of cooked parsnips is full of dietary fiber (3 grams) and contains more than 10% of the daily values of vitamin C and folate. Try these pale beauties roasted, pureed into soup or mashed. You can even top a shepherd's pie with mashed parsnips instead of the traditional mashed potatoes!

Cranberries

Fall is the time to get to know these tart berries and their wealth of nutritional benefits. Fresh and dried cranberries pair well with a variety of meats and poultry. Fresh cranberries can be eaten raw but often are cooked. Dried cranberries are delicious in grain and vegetable salads and make a healthy snack on the go.",food-groups

Plan Grocery Shopping around Sales

The key to smart, budget-friendly grocery shopping is planning ahead. Plan meals around fresh produce, lean protein foods and low-fat dairy items that are on sale and in season to save money while eating healthy.

Check store sale flyers and available coupons on the same items for additional savings. Compare national brands and private store labels for the lowest price. Once you've identified sale items, incorporate them into simple meals — baked, grilled or broiled lean meats or fish served with vegetables and whole grains are delicious and healthy with few added ingredients. Also, use the unit price to compare cost between different sized packages of the same product.

Create a Shopping List

Use your weekly eating plan to create a master grocery list and stick to it. Prioritize your food dollars for nutrient-rich vegetables, fruits, low-fat dairy, lean protein foods and whole grains. To keep your grocery list from growing too long, prepare meals that include similar ingredients throughout the week.

Shopping the Produce Section

When it comes to fresh vegetables and fruits, shop seasonally. Local, seasonal produce is at its peak flavor and is generally more abundant, so it's usually sold at a lower price.

Look for Frozen or Canned Alternatives

If the produce item you want isn't in season or doesn’t fit in your budget, consider purchasing itfrozen or canned. Fresh, frozen, canned and dried fruits and vegetables can be good for you. Canned and frozen fruits and vegetables are picked at peak freshness and can be just as nutritious as fresh foods because canning and freezing preserves many nutrients. Canned and frozen foods offer an alternative to fresh and may be more budget friendly. Be sure to check the ingredients list to avoid items with added sugars or salt.

Budget Shopping at the Meat Counter

Consider purchasing a larger quantity of meat that is on sale and preparing enough for two or more meals. Enjoy leftovers later in the week or freeze for future use. Because meat is often the highest dollar ingredient in a recipe, consider planning meatless meals a few nights each week, or try replacing half the meat in dishes such as chili, meatloaf or burger patties with beans, finely minced mushrooms, or chopped vegetables. Incorporating more non-meat proteins, including beans, nuts and eggs, can be cost-effective and nutritious.

Buying Whole Grains and Dry Goods

Whole grains and dried beans are generally inexpensive and are an easy way to get more nutrition for your buck. Stock up on these nonperishable items when on sale or take advantage of the bulk bin by purchasing only the amount you need. Dried beans, peas and lentils are great options to keep on hand. You can buy in bulk, prepare ahead of time and then freeze so you always have protein and fiber-rich foods on hand.

Reduce Waste

Once you've done your shopping, make the most of your food spending by cutting down on waste. Plan to use highly perishable items — such as fish and seafood, salad greens, berries and fresh herbs — early in the week, and save more hearty items for later in the week. Enjoy leftovers for lunch or create new meals from leftover ingredients. Cooked meat and vegetables can be revamped as a filling for a casserole, frittata or soup.",planning

When cooking and preparing food for your next family reunion, church function or other group gathering, follow these important steps for a safely prepared mega meal everyone can enjoy.

1. Make a plan

If you are preparing food at an event site, make sure you have appropriate appliances available to cook and store the food, as well as ample work space.

When transporting food, keep hot and cold foods at safe temperatures:Hot food must be kept at or above 140°F and should be wrapped well and placed in an insulated container. Food may be held in an oven, on a serving line in heated chafing dishes, in warming trays and in slow cookers. Just be sure food remains at or above 140°F.Cold food must be kept at or below 40°F and placed in a cooler filled with ice or ice packs. Food that will be portioned and served on the serving line should be held in a shallow container and placed inside a deep pan filled partially with ice to keep food cold. Drain off water as ice melts and replace ice frequently.

2. Separate

Raw meat, poultry, seafood and eggs should be prepared on separate surfaces from ready-to-eat foods like vegetables and bread. Never place cooked or ready-to-eat food on the same surface as raw food.

3. Keep everything clean.

Frequently wash food prep surfaces and all dishes and utensils with hot, soapy water.

Wash handswith soap and warm water for a minimum of 20 seconds before and after handling food.

4. Cook it all the way

Cook food to a safe temperature to destroy harmful bacteria. Use afood thermometerto check for doneness.

Food should always be cooked completely. The risk of foodborne illness increases with improperly cooked food.

5. Store it fast or discard it.

Perishable food should berefrigeratedor frozen within two hours of purchase or preparation and within one hour if the temperature is above 90°F.

Leftovers should be refrigerated or placed in the freezer immediately.",home-food-safety

Reviewed:April 27, 2023","Whether it is a wonderful memory of cafeteria staff or a favorite meal enjoyed with friends, we all remember the time spent in the school cafeteria. The National School Lunch Program was established in 1946 to provide students access to nutritionally balanced meals. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) continues to fund the program and to ensure that healthful lunches are available to all.

Thanks to the USDA's Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, school meals look a lot like MyPlate, the government's roadmap for nutritious eating.MyPlatecreates a common language for school nutrition professionals and students and the accompanying visual helps school children connect to the food they see on their plates.

Who Makes the Rules?

Regulations regarding what kinds of foods schools should serve to students are approved by the USDA, and each state administers the program. In 2007, the USDA reported that school meals were not providing a variety of whole grains, fruits and vegetables and were serving a higher than recommended amount of saturated fat and sodium. This prompted changes in the program. The 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act mandated updates to the meal requirements, which included more fruits, vegetables and whole grains, fewer calories and less sodium. A new rule titled ""Child Nutrition Programs: Flexibilities for Milk, Whole Grains, and Sodium Requirements,"" which went into effect in 2019, offers more flexibility for menu planning in schools compared to the original 2010 Act.

Here's what you need to know about today's school lunch programs.

A Bigger Focus on Fruits and Vegetables

Potentially the most powerful MyPlate message is advice to fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables at each meal. Schools serve fruit every day at breakfast as well as a fruit and a vegetable at lunch. School nutrition professionals understand that increasing the amount of fruits and vegetables on the menu doesn't always mean kids will eat more of them. Schools are becoming more strategic about serving produce in ways that will increase kids' interest and consumption. That means slicing fruit and vegetables into bite-sized pieces and serving them with dips, tossing fruit into yogurt parfaits and mixing vegetables into side dishes such as brown rice, grain salads and roasted potatoes.

Grains Are Getting a Whole Lot Healthier

In keeping with MyPlate's message to make at least half of all grains whole, schools are boosting whole grains in bread, tortillas, pizza crust and pasta so that half of the grains offered at breakfast and lunch each week are from whole-grain sources. They also are incorporating more whole-grain flour into baked goods such as muffins and pancakes.

Protein Slims Down

Most school-aged kids need 4 to 6½ ounces of protein each day. To keep it heart-healthy, MyPlate encourages fish, skinless chicken and lean meat as well as plenty of plant-based protein. This might include menu items such as oven-baked fish nuggets, chicken teriyaki and lean beef or bean burritos on whole-wheat tortillas. When it comes to plant-based protein, schools are getting creative — they're offering options such as tofu stir-fries and bean burgers and tacos.

Milk Got a Makeover

MyPlate isn't just about what's on the plate. Drinks count too. The latest rule now allows schools to offer 1% flavored milk to encourage drinking milk, in addition to unflavored fat-free and low-fat options.

Getting Financial Assistance

If you're having trouble paying for your child's lunch, your family may be eligible for free or reduced cost lunches through theUSDA. Income eligibility guidelines can be found on the USDA's website. If your family meets the income guidelines and you have not yet filled out an application, be sure to request one from your child's school. If your child has medical condition or other special dietary needs, talk to the school foodservice director about accommodations. Want to know more about what's happening in your child's school?

Cultivating Connections: How to Start or Participate In a Community Garden,https://www.eatright.org/food/planning/food-security-and-sustainability/community-gardens,"Contributors:Denine Rogers, MS, RDN, LD, FANDPublished:February 19, 2024
Published:February 19, 2024","According to the National Gardening Association’s 2023 survey, the onset of inflation led more people to become involved with community gardens, which help people save money by allowing them to grow their own fruits, vegetables and herbs. A community garden is a parcel of land that is gardened by a group of people individually or collectively. The land is usually divided into plots where each gardener is responsible for cultivating the plants that belong to them on their individual plot.

A community garden also offers the opportunity to give back by donating a portion of the harvest to local soup kitchens, food banks and food pantries. In 2021, more than 34 million Americans, including more than 9 million children, needed to utilize food programs that address food insecurity because they could not afford to purchase the food they needed. Community gardens can help to fill this need.

Interested in joining a local community garden?The American Community Gardening Associationis a grassroots nonprofit advocacy organization linked to 2,100 community gardens across Canada and the United States. They aim to “build community by increasing and enhancing community gardening and greening.”

The Extension Master Gardener program has supported community gardens since 1972, making it one of the largest volunteer organizations in the country with more than 86,076 volunteers in all 50 states, plus several Canadian provinces and South Korea.Learn how to become a volunteer of your local Extension Master Gardener program.

Want to start a neighborhood community garden? Begin by consulting resources such as theUniversity of Georgia Cooperative Extension, which recommends the following steps:

Have a plan and determine if enough people are interested in having a community garden. You will need at least three to five people to be part of the planning committee. Make sure to establish community garden rules about maintaining plots. These rules should factor in the size or demand of the garden and guide gardeners on what is expected of them.

Consider how you will fund the community garden. While collecting dues is one way to support the garden, many community gardens are now seeking sponsors. Sponsoring organizations may help by providing land or tools and assistance with liability insurance. Some community garden committees are becoming nonprofit organizations that accept donations and apply for funding grants. The U.S. Department of Agriculture hasfunding resourcesthat can help you start and grow your community garden.

Decide the types of plants the community garden members will grow. Having this information will help to narrow the search for the perfect location. If the community garden committee wants to grow food, finding a place that provides at least six hours of direct sunlight daily with easy access to a safe water source is vital. Check if the land has proper drainage for food to grow. Find out who the landowner of this site is and contact them about using the land — and whether buying or leasing it are options.

Research the history and past uses of the site. Once the past uses have been determined, take samples of the soil and have them analyzed for soil type and quality. Consult with your state's environmental agency, local health department or county's cooperative extension office on how to take a soil sample and determine what types of samples you need based on the land’s history. This step provides information that may influence the design or location of your community garden.

Before you start planting, it is important to get rid of any weeds and hard clay soil. Then, bring in compost (also known as “black gold”), which consists of materials such as leaves, shredded twigs and kitchen scraps from plants. It is referred to as “black gold” because of the natural organic compost benefits it offers in improving soil structure, boosting nutrients in the soil, and attracting earthworms and beneficial insects to prevent infestation. Compost is a valuable and accessible soil enhancer that saves community gardeners money. It improves the physical conditions of the soil, reducing compaction and improving root growth and water-retention capacity. Organic composting is perfect for the community garden and reduces the amount of materials going to landfills.

The best plants to bring to your community garden are not those sold in the local garden center or seed catalogs, but those found in community gardens — cuttings or seeds of established plants. Cuttings are used to form new roots and stems to become a complete, independent plant. Your neighborhood community garden can organize a plant swap event, encouraging others to share their favorite plant cuttings and seeds. You also can share cuttings of one of your favorite landscapes or houseplants with neighbors in the community.

The benefits of community gardens are vast. Participating in a community garden can provide neighbors with an opportunity to connect one-on-one and help people living with food insecurity, while promoting sustainable agriculture by reducing negative environmental impacts, such as minimizing food transportation. Community gardens create habitats and can improve the conservation of the land area.Now get out, meet your neighbors and make a difference in your community garden!",planning

Foods That Will Clear Security

Packing nutritious snacks is especially important while traveling, because options while traveling can be limited and you might not be able to eat at regular meal times. Keeping satisfying snacks on hand will help prevent hunger from adding to the stress of travel.

Try making your own homemade trail mix with whole-grain cereal, nuts and a sprinkling of dried fruit. Fresh whole fruit, such as apples and bananas, and your favorite whole-grain snack bars are easy to pack and will make it through security.

Concourse Options

If you aren't able to pack snacks, look for nourishing options at airport shops and restaurants. Look for high-fiber granola bars, pretzels, peanut butter crackers, packages of peanuts, hummus or fruit.

Many airport restaurants have a variety of meals to suit diverse preferences. From Mediterranean salads loaded with vegetables and beans to grilled chicken and salmon, there are plenty of nutrient-dense options to choose from.

You also can buy a packaged salad or sandwich and bring it on the plane with you. Just remember to eat it within two hours of removing it from refrigeration to prevent foodborne illness.

What to Drink

As always, staying hydrated is important. Drinking plenty of water can help fight feelings of fatigue and can keep your immune system running at its peak. Bring an empty reusable water bottle with you and fill it up at a drinking fountain once you get through security. Many airports offer filtered water as well. That way you don't have to spend money on bottled water.

Tips for Travelers with Dietary Restrictions

Finding food in the airport can be a challenge for those with special dietary considerations. For example, for vegetarian or vegan travelers, global cuisine is often a great choice — a Mexican restaurant serving bean burritos, a Chinese restaurant serving vegetable stir fry with tofu, or a Middle Eastern restaurant serving hummus and falafel.

Or, research your options ahead of time. Plan ahead and go onto the airport's website and find out exactly what the eating places are in your terminal. Make sure you have time in your schedule to grab food. When in doubt, eat before heading to the airport and bring nutritious, satisfying snacks with you.",planning
Yom Kippur,https://www.eatright.org/food/cultural-cuisines-and-traditions/holidays-and-celebrations/yom-kippur,"Author:Melissa Altman-Traub, MS, RDN, LDN
Published:September 20, 2023","Yom Kippur, known as the Day of Atonement, is a very important holiday in Judaism. Occurring on the tenth day of the month ofTishrei(orTishri) in the Hebrew calendar, Yom Kippur falls between mid-September to mid-October. The High Holy Days (also called the Days of Awe) start with Rosh Hashanah (the Jewish New Year), which is celebrated on the first and second day of Tishrei, and end with Yom Kippur. As with all Jewish holidays, they begin at sundown the night before.

Holiday Traditions

Those who observe Yom Kippur practicet’shuvah, or repentance, during this time. According to Jewish rabbinical teachings, at Rosh Hashanah, the Books of Life of the righteous, the wicked and those in between are opened — and God decides on which book people are listed by Yom Kippur.

Since Yom Kippur is a serious time for self-reflection, it would not be appropriate to say, “Happy Yom Kippur” or “Happy Holidays.” A wish for a good or meaningful holiday is more appropriate, org’mar chatima tovah, which means “may you be written in the Book of Life for good.” “Have an easy fast” is another considerate wish.TheKol Nidreis chanted in synagogues on the night Yom Kippur begins. This means “all vows” and the service includes the annulment of vows made to God that were not kept in the past year. People request forgiveness from God. They also may take this time to seek reconciliation with others by asking forgiveness from people they may have harmed during the year, and grant forgiveness to one another.

Synagogue services last the full day of Yom Kippur with an afternoon break. As the focus is on spirituality, practicing Jews traditionally abstain from working; brushing teeth; wearing jewelry, makeup or leather shoes; bathing; eating and drinking; and sexual relations, as outlined in Leviticus and Numbers. This allows for focus on the meaning of the holiday. People may wear white to represent purity and the resemblance to the Orthodox Jewish burial shroud.

Remembering family members who have passed away is part of Yom Kippur. It is common to visit their graves before the holiday. People recite a memorial prayer and light yahrzeit candles before sundown to burn for the holiday. Contributions to charity, calledtzedakah, are made. The end of Yom Kippur is marked with a long blast from theshofar, a ram’s horn, after which people go home to eat as an end to the fast.

Fasting for Yom Kippur

The fast includes abstaining from all food and drink and lasts from before sunset on the evening before Yom Kippur until after sunset on Yom Kippur, which is 25 hours. Adolescents may start fasting at different ages in various congregations and countries; however, those younger than 9 are discouraged from fasting.

Judaism has the principle ofpikuah nefesh— saving a life — so there are exceptions for people with medical concerns. Pregnant individuals and those recently postpartum are exempt, as well as those with health conditions. For example, people with diabetes and other diseases that would be impacted by fasting should discuss their medications and fasting with their physician and registered dietitian nutritionist to determine a safe plan before the holiday. People who are permitted to eat or drink often choose to have very little when observing Yom Kippur.

In preparation for the fast, it is recommended to drink enough water the day before the fast and to limit salty or spicy foods that can result in uncomfortable thirst. People who usually consume caffeine may want to gradually cut back ahead of time for an easier adjustment during the fast.

The dinner before the fast, called theseuda mafseket, may be a light meal for some families or a large meal for others. Typical foods include chicken, fish, dumplings (kreplach), and a round challah (bread made with eggs) that contains raisins and is dipped in honey.

To break the fast, families typically gather and enjoy a variety of foods based on their family’s culture and heritage. Among the Ashkenazi (descendants of Eastern Europe) community, favorites include bagels, lox, herring and other smoked fish, cream cheese, tuna salad, egg salad, kugel (a baked noodle pudding) and challah — all of which can be prepared before Yom Kippur starts. Another option is a hearty meal with meats cooked ahead of time that are reheated. For dessert, cookies, fresh fruit, rugelach (a rich cookie made with layered flaky dough, cream cheese and filling),babka(a yeast raised sweet bread often containing chocolate or cinnamon), honey cake or sponge cake may be served.

In the Sephardic community (originally from Spain and Mediterranean regions), families may break the fast by drinking water and having a date or small snack, such as Iranianfaloodeh, made with grated apples, sugar, rosewater and water. A larger meal with meats, chicken or fish would be served a little later. The recipes served vary widely among different countries; for example,harirais a Moroccan soup that may include meat or be vegetarian with chickpeas, lentils, rice, vegetables, tomatoes and spices. If the meal contains dairy foods,zom, which is a warm yogurt soup from Yemen, may be served with challah andschug(a sauce with herbs, garlic and olive oil).",cultural-cuisines-and-traditions

Tips for College Students: The Refrigerator

Whether you’re using a mini-fridge or a full-sized one, follow these tips and remember to refrigerate foods quickly to slow the growth of bacteria and reduce your risk of food poisoning.

The refrigerator temperature should be at 40°F or below and the freezer should be kept at 0°F or lower.

While refrigerator size may vary, it's important to not over pack the refrigerator as cool air needs to circulate to keep food safe.

Keep the refrigerator closed as much as possible and don't store perishable foods like milk and eggs in the door, place them towards the center of the refrigerator instead.

Refrigerate all perishables including leftovers within two hours (one hour if it is over 90°F outside).

Store foods in containers or wrap them well to prevent moisture loss or absorption of odors.

Maintain a clean refrigerator and discard foods that are molding or have been kept too long.  As a general rule, leftovers should be consumed within three to four days.",home-food-safety
Different Kinds of Lettuces and Greens,https://www.eatright.org/food/food-groups/vegetables/different-kinds-of-lettuces-and-greens,"Published:January 11, 2021
Reviewed:June 23, 2023","Lettuce, a type of leafy green, is among the more commonly eaten veggies in the United States. Leafy greens can be either dark or light in color and include types such as spinach, romaine, kale, escarole, and endive. Mesclun, a mix of young salad greens, offers a variety of different types, such as arugula, frisée and radicchio, but the exact mix might vary.

Dark leafy greens offer plenty of the antioxidant beta-carotene, which helps to form vitamin A in the body and may help lower the risk for certain diseases. Some greens deliver folate, potassium and dietary fiber, too. Greens can supply lutein, which contributes to good vision and may help protect your eyes from macular degeneration, and they provide vitamin K, which plays a role in blood clotting and bone health.

A small addition of fat can help with the absorption of certain nutrients. Check the Nutrition Fact Label or choose dressings made with oils more often, because they provide unsaturated fat, which is considered to be healthier than cream-based dressings.

Perk up your salad-making with more flavor, color and texture by mixing in different greens.

For a peppery flavor try arugula or watercress.

For leaves that aren't green try red-and-white radicchio.

For flavor with a ""bite"" try chicory or escarole.

For a mild flavor and delicate green color try mâche, Boston or Bibb lettuce.

For a deep-green color try spinach.

For a crisp texture try romaine

Many leafy greens, such as spinach, kale and collard greens, also are well suited for cooking. Try sautéing them in a little oil, then season with spices, such as garlic and just a little salt and pepper. When cooked, greens can shrink down by half, so this is important to consider when planning meals.

Greens also can be added to soups, stews, casseroles and other dishes. For example, baby spinach leaves add a nice flavor and color when folded into an omelet. They also can be added toward the end when making a homemade soup. Kale can be baked into chips, which makes for a great tasting, healthy snack.

Look for different types of leafy greens at your local grocery store or farmers market. Keep them refrigerated and be sure to wash and dry the leaves thoroughly before using. Enjoy within a few days, as the leaves are likely to wilt or spoil if stored beyond that time frame.",food-groups

This collection of cooking essentials for your kitchen is a great starting place to help you prepare healthful and delicious meals at home.

Mixing bowls:Look for bowls in various sizes. Bowls that stack into each other are great if you’re low on space.

Strainer:A strainer is perfect for draining pasta, washing fruits and vegetables, and for sorting and rinsing legumes such as lentils and beans. Strainers also can be used in place of salad spinners to dry lettuce and other leafy green vegetables.

Knives and vegetable peelers:Start with a paring knife, small and medium chef's or Santoku knives, and a serrated knife. Don't forget to buy a sharpener. A vegetable peeler can make removing the skin of produce easier.

Several cutting boards:Whether they are wooden, bamboo or plastic is less important than keeping them clean and dry. Use separate boards for raw meats and produce to prevent cross-contamination.

Wooden spoons:Wooden spoons are great choices because they don't transfer heat and they won't scratch the surface of pans. Plus, they are inexpensive.

A small and large whisk:Contrary to common belief, whisking some ingredients with a fork won't incorporate enough air. Use a small whisk for vinaigrettes and dressings, and a large one for aerating flour and beating eggs.

Heat-resistant spatula:Any spatula may be used to clean out a bowl, but not all are appropriate for hot pans.

Long tongs:Keep hands safe by using tongs to lift or turn foods when cooking over heat or reaching into an oven.

Grater:You can use a grater for cheese, garlic, ginger or citrus fruit zest.

Measuring cups and spoons:Liquids measure differently than solids like flour, so it’s helpful to include both dry and liquid measuring cups in your collection. Liquid volume measuring cups should be clear so you can see the measurement lines, and glass have the added benefit of handling hot temperatures without bending or warping like some plastics. Measuring spoons are also helpful for ingredients like baking powder, baking soda, extracts and spices.

Basic pots and pans:Everyone has their personal preferences when it comes to cookware, but instead of buying a large, expensive set to start, purchase individual pans as you need them. Perhaps begin with a pair of large and small sauté pans, a soup pot, a sauce pan and a Dutch oven — a type that can be used on the stove or in an oven.

Food Thermometer: When you’re keeping food safety in mind, a food thermometer is the only way to make sure foods have been cooked to the appropriate internal temperature.

Kitchen scale:While not necessary for cooking, it can help you familiarize yourself with amounts. Also, some recipes call for ounces instead of a cup measure.",food-preparation

Berries

Berries such as strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and blackberries provide vitamin C and antioxidants that can support kids' immune systems and overall health. They're also a good source of dietary fiber — with raspberries leading the way at 8 grams of fiber per 1-cup serving.

Avocados

Do your kids resist fruits and vegetables? Give buttery avocados a try. Avocados can be added to tacos, as a spread on grilled cheese sandwiches or with some eggs and fruit in the morning. They contain heart-healthy monounsaturated fat as well as fiber, vitamin E and potassium.

Tomatoes

While your family might enjoy debating if tomatoes are a vegetable or fruit, this superstar provides dietary fiber, vitamins A and C, potassium and other important vitamins and minerals. Available in a variety of colors and sizes, their naturally high water content makes tomatoes a hydrating choice. Slice tomatoes and serve with a little olive oil, basil, salt and pepper; add them to sandwiches; or, chop them up and toss them into salads and pasta dishes. Another fun idea: Have your kids help you make fresh salsa.

Watermelons

Nothing says summer like a fresh slice of watermelon. This summer favorite is easy to eat and tastes great. With one of the highest water contents of any food, it's great for keeping kids hydrated on scorching days. It's also a good source of vitamin C and is packed with lycopene. Watch out for seeds, which could be a potential choking hazard for young children.

Food at the farmers market can be more affordable and is often locally grown and naturally ripened. Taste is a key deciding factor in our food choices and delicious, fresh produce can help us eat the recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables.

Talk to the Farmer

Farmers markets are wonderful places to find your favorite summer foods such as tomatoes, berries, beets and herbs, but market-goers will find joy in discovering new foods as well. And when you encounter a new fruit variety or heirloom vegetable you've never seen before, you're in the right place to find out more about it — you can ask the farmer who grew it! They will likely have recommendations on preparing and serving the food, too.

Talking to the farmers also is a great idea if your goal is to buy locally or organically grown foods. Some farmers say they use organic methods, but choose not to submit to the process required to legally use the term; some farmers use a mixture of organic and conventional methods; some farmers make absolutely no claim to being organic; and some small organic farmers are permitted to call themselves ""organic"" but are not ""certified organic."" If these are important factors to you, be sure to ask farmers how they grow their food.

What's in Season?

To find your local markets and learn what your local farmers are harvesting right now, consider using websites such asLocalHarvest.organdLocal Food Directories. Even experienced farmers market patrons will benefit from these resources.

How to Shop

While many markets have sellers offering items such as free-range eggs, fresh breads and pastries, local honey, grass-fed beef and fresh-cut flowers, be sure to stock up on produce. Also, be mindful of food safety and pay attention to the vendors' food safety practices as you shop. For example, all meat and dairy products should be in a cooler with ice.",planning

Chia seeds come from the desert plantSalvia hispanica, a member of the mint family.Salvia hispanicaseeds are often sold under the common name ""chia"" as well as several trademarked names. Its origin is believed to be in Central America where the seed was a staple in the ancient Aztec diet. The seeds of a related plant,Salvia columbariae(golden chia), were used primarily by Native Americans in the southwestern United States.

Chia seeds have gained attention as an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acid. They also are an excellent source of dietary fiber, with 10 grams per ounce (about 2 tablespoons), and contain protein and minerals including iron, calcium, magnesium and zinc.

Emerging research suggests that including chia seeds as part of a healthful eating style may help improve cardiovascular risk factors such as lowering cholesterol, triglycerides and blood pressure. However, there are not many published studies on the health benefits of eating chia seeds and much of the available information is based on animal studies or human studies with a small number of research participants.

How to Eat Chia Seeds

Chia seeds can be eaten raw or prepared in a number of dishes. Sprinkle ground or whole chia seeds on cereal, rice, yogurt or vegetables. In Mexico, a drink called chia fresco is made by soaking chia seeds in fruit juice or water. Chia seeds are very absorbent and develop a gelatinous texture when soaked in water, making it easy to mix them into cooked cereal or other dishes.

The seeds are not the only important part of the chia plant; the sprouts also are edible. Try adding them to salads, sandwiches and other dishes.",food-groups

Wash

Wash handsbefore, during and after preparing food for a tailgate. Try singing your favorite team's fight song while lathering with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

Be sure to pack moist towelettes or hand sanitizer  for guests to clean up before digging in.

Separate

Alwaysdefrost meatsin the refrigerator   — never at the tailgate. Marinate meat in the refrigerator and don't reuse the marinade unless you boil it before using it again.

For the trip to the tailgate, tightly seal raw meat in plastic wrap to prevent juices from contaminating other food items. Store meat products in one cooler and additional foods in another, if possible.

Keep raw meats, poultry, seafood and eggs separatefrom ready-to-eat foods. Pack extra plates and utensils to help prevent cross-contamination. Consider using color-coded utensils and plates, so they don’t get mixed up when working with certain foods. Use one set for raw meat products and another for cooked and ready-to-eat foods.

Cook

Cook toproper internal temperatures. A food thermometer is the only reliable way to ensure foods are safe to eat.

Tailgating favorites such as hamburgers and bratwursts should be cooked to at least 160°F and chicken breasts need to be cooked to 165°F.

Refrigerate

Pack foodin a well-insulated cooler with plenty of ice or icepacks to keep the temperature below 40°F. Always keep a refrigerator thermometer inside the cooler to monitor the temperature.

In cool-weather climates, transport coolers in your trunk rather than in a heated car — the cold temperature outside will help keep food chilled. For warmer climates, do the opposite. Transport coolers in the backseat of your air-conditioned car instead of the hot trunk, especially for long road trips.

Throw away perishable tailgate items before entering the game. Foods should not be left unrefrigerated for more than two hours. In hot weather (90°F or above), this time is reduced to one hour.

Don't forget that carryout and/or pre-prepared foods also are susceptible to food poisoning.

After the game, serve and eat only non-perishable foods unless foods packed in the cooler remained at 40°F or below.",planning

Reckless Thawing

Old Habit:Thawing frozen turkey or other meats on the kitchen counter or under hot water in the kitchen sink.

New Tradition:To prevent the spread of harmful bacteria, frozen meats and poultry should be thawed in a refrigerator set at or below 40°F. If pressed for time, you can thaw a wrapped frozen turkey in a sink filled with cold tap water, making sure to change the water every 30 minutes.  Depending on the size of the turkey, it may be defrosted in the microwave, but check the owner's manual for your machine and be prepared to cook it right after thawing. A frozen turkey also can be cooked in the oven to its safe, minimum internal temperature of 165°F, but it will take longer to cook than if it is thawed first.

Holding Out on Hot Stuff

Old Habit:When preparing a cooked dish that needs to chill (for storage or serving purposes), waiting until foods cool before putting them in the refrigerator.

New Tradition:To ensure the freshness and safety of your freshly cooked foods, place them promptly in the refrigerator after cooking.  Using shallow containers will allow them to cool more quickly.

Covered Dish Delivery

Old Habit:For holiday festivities with family and friends that require travel, bringing dishes to share on long car rides.

New Tradition:Pay close attention to how much time your prepared dish will be out of the refrigerator or oven.  A cold dish can be packed in a cooler with ice packs to keep it cold while traveling.  Hot dishes can be transported in an insulated bag that is intended to keep foods hot or covered with foil and insulated with towels. Cold dishes should be kept below 40°F and hot dishes above 140°F. If the dish is outside these temperature zones for two hours or more, it should be discarded.

Rocking the Gravy Boat

Old Habit:Forgetting to bring gravy to a boil before serving it with leftovers.

New Tradition:In order to eliminate harmful bacteria, always bring leftover gravy to a boil on the stove before serving it a second time.  Any leftover gravy should be used within three to four days.

Festive Floor-Grazing

Old Habit:Abiding by the ""five-second-rule"" to determine how long food is safe to eat after it falls on the floor.

Reviewed:June 29, 2023","Preventing cross-contamination is an important way to reduce the spread and growth of bacteria. It occurs when juices from raw meats or germs from unclean objects touch cooked or ready-to-eat foods. By following a few simple steps as you shop, store, cook, and transport foods, you can greatly reduce your risk of food poisoning.

Step 1: Shop Safe

Wrap raw meat, poultry and seafood in plastic bags from the produce department to prevent juices from leaking onto other foods, and choose packaging that is well sealed and not leaking.

Separate fresh or frozen raw meat, poultry, seafood and eggs from produce and ready-to-eat foods in your shopping cart.

To transport groceries, pack meats, seafood, poultry and eggs in plastic bags before placing in a different shopping bag or tote than other foods. While you're at it, pack frozen and refrigerated foods separately from room temperature foods. This helps keep cold foods chilled until you get home, and it simplifies unpacking too.

Step 2: Store Safe

When storing perishable foods, refrigerate or freeze groceries right away.

Prevent juices from meat, poultry and seafood from leaking onto other foods by storing them on the bottom shelf of your refrigerator in individual plastic bags or in their own containers.

Keep eggs in their original disposable carton on the shelves, instead of in the refrigerator door.

Store perishable fruits and vegetables in individual plastic bags in the produce drawer. This keeps them safe from yeast, mold and microbes that may lurk in the drawer.

Store reusable totes in a clean, dry location and wash frequently with hot, soapy water or in the washing machine. Avoid leaving reusable totes in the trunk of a vehicle.

Step 3: Prepare Safe

Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before preparing food. And wash them again before and after handling raw meats and foods, as well as between tasks.

Raw meats, poultry and seafood should not be washed before cooking.

Be aware of the tools used during cooking — never use the same knife for raw meat, poultry or seafood to chop produce or ready-to-eat foods. Also, use one utensil to taste and a different one to prepare food.

Investing in two different cutting boards, one for produce and one for raw meat, poultry and seafood can go a long way in preventing cross-contamination in your kitchen. Since grooves from old cutting boards can harbor bacteria, replace cutting boards as soon as they become worn.

Wash all produce under running water before using. Soaps and other cleansers are not recommended for fruits and vegetables. Dry off any unused, washed produce before putting it into clean storage containers, not back into the original ones.

Marinate raw meat, chicken or fish in the refrigerator, not on the counter. If you want to brush marinade on cooked meat, set a small amount of the marinade aside before you add it to the raw meat. Then later, when you brush it on use a fresh, clean brush. Leftover marinades from grilled meat, chicken or fish can be swimming with bacteria, so they should be boiled before reusing or thrown out.

Wash plates between uses or use separate plates: one for holding raw meat, poultry or seafood and another for cooked foods.

Stirring spoons, serving forks, slicing knives and plates used to hold raw food can be coated with bacteria. Be sure to replace or wash soiled utensils and plates as soon as they come into contact with raw food, and always serve cooked food on a clean plate.

Keep dishcloths, counters and other surfaces clean.

Step 4: Transport Safe

Sanitize coolers before using and wash reusable bags that will be used to transport food.

Lunch boxes and bento boxes can harbor bacteria, too. Keep them clean by washing them with warm, soapy water after each use.

Keep foods at the proper temperature by using thermal containers and cold packs.

Play it safe — to reduce the risk for food poisoning, separate raw meat, poultry, fish and eggs from ready-to-eat foods and follow the above steps for handling food properly.",home-food-safety

If you’ve never heard of white whole-wheat flour, you’re not alone. Many people don’t know about this kid-friendly ingredient. The term ""white"" refers to the type and color of the kernels. Instead of a brown outer shell, the outer shell of these kernels is white. And, you make white whole-wheat flour from these white-colored wheat kernels.

Both white whole-wheat flour and whole-wheat flour are whole grains. Red wheat kernels milled with the bran are what most Americans think of as whole-wheat flour. The bran has a dark color, heavy texture and a flavor that some don’t like. Traditional white flour, called refined all-purpose flour, also is made from red wheat kernels. However, there is no bran in this refined flour. Therefore, it is not a whole grain.

In the Kitchen

TheDietary Guidelines for Americansrecommend that people eat more whole grains. And, many think their only choice is whole-wheat flour. While this type of flour is full of nutrients, it's not a favorite for baking, as it makes baked goods heavy. To get around this, recipes often mix whole-wheat flour with refined all-purpose flour. But, the final baked product won't be 100% whole-grain.

White whole-wheat flour, on the other hand, is lighter in color and texture, milder in flavor and sweeter in taste. Use it in recipes and get the dietary fiber, vitamins and minerals without sacrificing taste. Baked goods made with white whole-wheat flour mimic their refined counterparts in color and texture. It is a terrific way to boost your family's whole grains intake with minimal effort. The milder flavor of white whole wheat may be more acceptable to children, too. Additionally, the sweetness of white whole wheat allows you to use less sugar or other sweeteners when baking.

In the Store

Most mainstream grocery stores sell white whole-wheat flour and products made with this flour. Look for words including “100% whole wheat"" on bread packages and other products touting a whole-grain status. Or, you can look for the Whole Grain Council's ""100% Whole Grain"" stamp. To tell the difference between products made with white whole-wheat flour and those made with regular white flour, look at the ingredients list. Pick items that have whole wheat, not refined or enriched wheat.",food-groups

Use Only Microwave-Safe Containers

Look for cookware that is specially manufactured for use in the microwave oven.

Make sure that glass, ceramic containers and all plastics are labeled as safe for microwave oven use.

Do not use foam trays and plastic wraps because they are not heat stable at high temperatures. Melting or warping may cause harmful chemicals to migrate into food.

Learn Your Microwave's Power or Wattage

Make sure that any electrical equipment in your kitchen, such as air fryers and toaster ovens, do not compete with the current or reduce the electrical wattage of a microwave.

Set the microwave for the maximum time given in the instructions and avoid using an extension cord because power is reduced as it flows down the cord.

Thaw Food Using the Defrost Button on Your Microwave

Remove food from packaging before defrosting.

Cook meat, poultry, egg casseroles and fish immediately after defrosting in the microwave because some areas of the frozen food may begin to cook during the defrosting time.

Reheat and Cook Foods Safely

Avoid microwaving food in original packaging (unless it specifically says microwave-safe) because chemicals from these products may migrate to the food.

Microwave frozen meals according to package directions so they reach the proper internal temperature.

Cut food for microwaving into same-size pieces to ensure even cooking.

Cover food well to keep it moist, promote even cooking and prevent splatters.

Rotate food for even cooking.

Use a food thermometer to check doneness. Harmful bacteria are destroyed only when food is cooked to proper temperatures.

Stir things up.For a quick breakfast, add raisins or chopped dates to instant oatmeal, or stir blueberries, strawberries or sliced banana into whole-grain cereal with fat-free milk.

Get scrambling!Add fresh or frozen chopped spinach, mushrooms and diced tomatoes to scrambled eggs or omelets. Really, any veggies will work!

Make a breakfast sandwich.Top a whole-wheat English muffin with either reduced-fat peanut butter and banana slices, or go savory with hummus, sliced cucumbers, tomato and fresh spinach.

Batter up.Add grated carrots or zucchini to pancake, quick bread or muffin batter.

Drink your produce.Whirl carrots and fresh orange juice in a blender for a refreshing breakfast beverage.

Say ""Olé!""Make a breakfast burrito by wrapping low-fat cheddar cheese, scrambled eggs and diced bell peppers in a whole-wheat tortilla. You also can make a vegetable-and-cheese quesadilla in a nonstick pan with a scant amount of canola oil.

Pick a fruit pizza.Spread reduced-fat dinner rolls in a pizza pan and bake. Top the pizza with orange sections or slices of kiwi, apples or strawberries and drizzle fat-free vanilla yogurt over the top.

Make a quick white or sweet potato hash.Grate the potatoes — they cook faster that way. Place the potatoes in a glass bowl and microwave about three minutes or until hot; drain any juice. Heat a skillet or frying pan on the stove and then stir-fry the potatoes with a teaspoon of olive oil until crispy.

Make it savory.While fruit is more commonly added to oatmeal, switch it up by adding sauteed vegetables such as mushrooms or onions to unsweetened instant oatmeal for a savory twist. Sprinkle it with cheese for added flavor.",planning

For some, eggs are off limits due to dietary preferences or allergies. Or, sometimes, you just cracked your last one and are simply out. And, although they traditionally have been relatively low in cost, the price of eggs is subject to change and can rise due to various reasons, including egg shortages caused by bird flu. Whatever the case, consider integrating egg alternatives as staples in your kitchen.

Egg Alternatives: The Basics

Egg alternatives can be used in both cooking and baking. The alternative you use will depend on the desired function of the egg in that particular recipe. Eggs in recipes for baked goods are used for functions such as binding, leavening and adding moisture and richness to the baked product, while their use in savory dishes is often more straightforward. Egg alternatives range from chia gel to tofu, in addition to mixes that make egg replacement easy and effective. For example, one mix on the market is made from chia seeds and garbanzo beans, in which 1 tablespoon of mix is combined with 2 tablespoons water to provide the equivalent of one egg for use as a binder in recipes. If you choose to use these products, follow package instructions for the best results.

How to Use Egg Alternatives

Here are some top picks for replacing eggs in recipes. One large egg is close to 3 tablespoons in volume. Keep this measurement in mind as a guide during cooking and baking.

Scrambled egg alternative:In place of each large egg, cube 2 ounces firm tofu. Sauté while slightly smashing the tofu when preparing to achieve the look of scrambled eggs. Add a pinch of turmeric for an egg-like yellow color. Sprinkle with nutritional yeast and add a pinch of salt, black pepper or red pepper flakes for a pop of flavor.

Boiled egg alternative:To mimic the protein and texture of hard-boiled eggs in salads and sandwiches, dice extra-firm tofu (2 ounces tofu for each boiled egg you're replacing) and use as you would for chopped hard-boiled eggs. Ready-to-eat baked tofu and white beans are other great options.

Binding in baking:When chia seeds are stirred into water, juice or other liquid, the mixture becomes a recipe-ready gel, which acts as a binder and holds all ingredients together in a baked item. Try this standard version as a large egg equivalent: Mix 1 tablespoon chia seeds with 3 tablespoons water; let stand for 5 minutes. Prefer flaxseed? A tablespoon of ground flaxseed added to the same amount of water can be used instead of chia seeds.

Leavening in baking:When you need a baked good to rise, make chia or flaxseed gel as indicated above, then add ½ teaspoon baking powder to the batter. Multiply based on the number of eggs in the original recipe. Powdered egg replacers also are popular and easy to use — simply follow the manufacturer's instructions and mix the powder with water.

Moistness and richness in baking:Whether your recipe is sweet or savory, these egg alternatives are versatile in baking and provide a winning combination of moistness and richness: mashed banana, applesauce, pureed avocado, garbanzo beans or silken tofu. Use ¼ cup of any of these plant-based ingredients to replace one large egg.

The list of egg alternatives in cooking and baking is nearly limitless. When foregoing eggs, experiment with various fruits and vegetables that you have on hand, such as prune puree, apple butter, pumpkin puree and mashed potatoes or sweet potatoes — which are especially ideal for providing moistness while boosting plant-based nutrients. If leavening is needed, also add ½ teaspoon baking powder for each egg being replaced.",food-preparation

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), alcohol-based hand sanitizers can help reduce the amount of germs and bacteria on your hands, but they do not get rid of all types of bacteria. They may also be less effective if you have dirt, grease or other substances on your hands, so should not be used to replace hand washing.

If you choose to use hand sanitizers, use one with at least 60% alcohol and follow the CDC’s recommendations below.

Hand Sanitizer How-To

Proper hand-washing is best, but when soap and water aren't available, hand sanitizers can help keep your hands clean.

Check the label for how much to use and apply the product to the palm of one hand.

Rub your hands together.

Rub the product over all surfaces of your hands and fingers until your hands are dry, about 20 seconds..

Proper Hand Washing

Washing hands with soap and water is especially important if your hands are visibly dirty or if you have or are around certain types of germs, such asNorovirus.

Wet your hands with clean running water and apply soap.

Rub your hands together, lathering and scrubbing well; be sure to scrub the backs of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.

Continue rubbing your hands for at least 20 seconds. This is about the time it takes to hum or sing ""Happy Birthday"" from beginning to end twice.

Rinse your hands well under running water.

Reviewed:July 23, 2023","You've got hungry kids in the car and you need food pronto, so you pull into the drive-thru at a fast food restaurant. We've all been there… but, hopefully, not too often. A 2013 study inJAMA Pediatricsfound that teenagers and younger children who eat fast food consume more calories  from takeout meals than meals prepared at home. In addition to excess calories, a steady intake of fast food may result in large amounts of saturated fat, added sugars and sodium and fall short on dietary fiber, vitamins and minerals.

Fast food meals for kids may have gotten more nutritious, with fruits and vegetables becoming common side dish options. But many quick-serve food establishments still offer less-than-desirable choices. While parents don't need to enforce a complete ban on fast food, make sure to choose the most nutrient-rich options in kid-appropriate portions.

Set Limits on Fast Food

The wafting smells of French fries or fresh doughnuts can play havoc on your resolve to order smart, so  be clear about your rules for fast food before ordering.  For example, let your kids know you want them to sip milk instead of soda or have a fruit or vegetable with their meal.

Arm Yourself with Nutrition Information

Many quick-serve establishments list nutritional content directly on their menu boards. Another place to check is online, so you can take a few minutes to study the best choices at a variety of fast food joints before you hit the road. When you don't have the time to check facts, keep these lighter choices in mind and ask for sauces, dressings, and condiments on the side:

Salad with grilled chicken

Grilled chicken wrap or fresh turkey wrap

Plain, kid-sized hamburger

Low-fat yogurt

Apple slices

Bean burritos or tacos

Chili

Large fruit cups

Small roast beef sandwich

Fat-free or low-fat milk

Mind the Portions

Order appropriate child-size meals for youngsters and resist supersizing meals for older kids, unless two or more children are splitting it. Adults also can order kid-sized meals, which automatically come with fruit and low-fat milk at some restaurants and supply about half the calories of some of the regular menu items.

Rethink Your Drink

Milk and water are appropriate options for younger children. Teenagers, who may be able to have more calories because they are active, might request regular soda or blended coffee beverages that are loaded with added sugars. These choices may displace more nutritious calories from milk or other foods. Instead, steer them toward the smallest size possible or have them split a larger size.

Plan for Healthful Snacking

Planning for hunger can help you avoid the pull of the drive-thru. Keep tasty and nutritious foods in the car, including dried fruit,  applesauce without added sugar in single-serve containers and nuts. On longer trips, take ice packs in a small cooler or refrigerator bag and stock it with fresh fruit, string cheese, low-fat yogurt, milk boxes, whole-grain crackers, nut butters or hummus and fresh veggies to tide you over or to supplement a fast food meal.",planning

Reviewed:September 26, 2023","According to the 2020-2025Dietary Guidelines for Americans, a healthy eating plan should limit the amount of calories from added sugars and saturated fat. So, does that mean no desserts?

While baked goods in particular have a reputation for being a major source of both added sugars and solid fats, they can still be an enjoyable part of a well-balanced eating pattern. Follow these tips to give baked goods a nutritional boost and help reduce their added sugar and saturated fat content.

Watch Portion Size

Keeping portion sizes in check is a primary strategy for incorporating baked goods into a healthful eating pattern. Make portion control easier by preparing miniature desserts such as mini cupcakes. Or, cut brownies and sheet cakes into 2-inch squares and portion cookie dough using a 1-tablespoon scoop.

Ingredients Matter

Use high-quality ingredients for a more flavorful product that will satisfy cravings even with smaller portions. For example, use vanilla beans instead of extract, opt for high-quality chocolate and make sure your spices are fresh for the boldest flavor.

Incorporate Nutrient-Rich Ingredients

Instead of focusing on what to cut out, why not focus on nutritious ingredients that can be added to your recipe?

Add a Fruit or VegetableTry adding shredded or pureed apple, carrot, banana and pumpkin to recipes to boost nutrients, flavor and moisture. You can use these ingredients to add extra flavor and replace some of the butter or oil in the recipe.

Try a Whole-Grain FlourWhite whole-wheat flour can be substituted one-for-one for all-purpose flour in most recipes. You also can replace up to half the all-purpose flour in a recipe with a whole-grain flour without making any major adjustments to the recipe.

Experiment with Recipes That Use Less-Common FloursTry experimenting with recipes such as savory pancakes and waffles that call for chickpea flour. Or try recipes with almond flour, which works well for crusts and can be incorporated into dough for a big punch of flavor and a different nutrient profile than wheat flour.

Use Low-Fat or Fat-Free Dairy ProductsUse lower fat versions of milk, buttermilk and yogurt in baking recipes to add protein and calcium. Consider swapping cream cheese frosting, which is high in calories and saturated fat and has minimal nutritional value, for a higher protein frosting made from low-fat Greek yogurt.

Reduce Saturated Fat and Added Sugars

You can do this in a number of ways. For example:

Swap Butter for Heart-Healthy OilWhen modifying a favorite recipe, you generally can trade some of the butter for a heart-healthy oil, such as canola oil. Don't replace all the butter with oil or you risk sacrificing texture.

Simply Cut Down On SugarAs a general rule, you can reduce sugar in a recipe by about 25% without noticeable differences. For instance, if a recipe calls for 4 tablespoons of sugar, reduce the amount to 3 tablespoons. When reducing sugar, you may need to increase the liquid in a recipe.

Focus on occasionally enjoying small portions of your favorite treats and experiment with creating healthier versions of favorite recipes for more nutrients in each delicious bite.",food-preparation

The celebration began in 1966, named and initiated by Maulana Karenga, PhD, a professor and activist.

The term “Kwanzaa” is derived from the Swahili phrase “matunda ya kwanza,” which loosely translates to “first fruits of the harvest.” The idea of Kwanzaa combines different African first fruits harvest celebrations.

Kwanzaa Traditions

A table is decorated with certain symbols of Kwanzaa, such as thekinara(candleholder). The candles in akinararepresent each of the seven principles of Kwanzaa, which are calledNguzo Saba. Thekinarafeatures three red candles, three green candles and one black center candle, also known as the unity candle.

Each night, one of the seven candles is lit — starting with the black candle, then the red candle on the immediate right, then the green candle on the immediate left, and so on — and one of the seven principles is discussed:

Umoja(black candle): The unity of the race, community and family

Kujichagulia: Self-determination and accountability

Ujima: Collective work and responsibility

Ujamaa: Cooperative economics by working together to build businesses

Nia: Purpose in remembering African and African American history and culture

Kuumba: Creativity in the community

Imani: Faith in people

Kwanzaa has seven symbols:

Mkeka: A straw mat that represents history, culture and tradition

Mazao: Nuts, fruits and vegetables placed on themkekato represent the family’s crops or harvest

Muhindi: Ears of corn that represent the future, children in the family and children in the community

Kinara: A candleholder that symbolizes the roots of the community

Mishumaa Saba: The seven candles that are placed on the kinara

Kikombe Cha Umoja: A unity cup passed from person to person to promote unity during the large meal

Zawadi: Handmade gifts for the children

In addition to thekinara, the table is decorated with amkeka,muhindi,mazaoandzawadi.

Common Kwanzaa Celebrations

While every family observes Kwanzaa in its own way, celebrations may include singing and dancing or playing African drums. Some families may share stories or read poems. Typically, a large traditional meal calledkaramuis served on the sixth day of Kwanzaa.

Karamuis made up of foods from African, Caribbean, South American and Southern cuisines. Foods served can differ greatly from family to family, but there are two foods with significant symbolism: black-eyed peas and collard greens.

Black-eyed peas are associated with good luck, and collard greens are said to represent money or fortune. Black-eyed peas are a good source of protein, dietary fiber and iron. Collard greens, a green leafy vegetable, deliver a variety of nutrients including vitamins A, C, K and folate plus antioxidants, fiber, and minerals including magnesium, calcium, iron and potassium.

Whether you are sending a package for the holidays, commemorating a special occasion or just showing that you care, keep food safety in mind when shipping care packages that contain food.

Why is this an issue? Foodborne pathogens grow faster between 40°F and 140°F, potentially doubling every 20 minutes, in what is often referred to as thetemperature danger zone. So, take extra precautions to ensure recipients of your care package feel the love and not the effects of food poisoning when they receive their gift.

Send Non-Perishable Foods

Foods that don’t require refrigeration stay fresher longer and are safe to keep at room temperature, so they make great homemade food gifts and have a lower risk of causing food poisoning. Some examples include:

Dried beef, fruits, canned nuts, dehydrated soups and fruit drink mixes

Canned meat and fish, along with shelf-stable dips and cracker spreads. Remember, any cans that appear to be damaged, dented or swollen should be thrown away.

Dense and dry baked goods such as fruitcakes and biscotti

Chocolates, cookies, hard candies and homemade sweets, such as pralines and toffee

Condiments, including hot sauce and seasonings, but avoid sending breakable glass containers

Commercially packaged cakes, cookies and crackers, but ship them in airtight tins

While you don't need to worry about the temperature of non-refrigerated foods, you should protect the original packaging. Sturdy packaging helps keep food undamaged for the bumpy ride ahead.

Keep Perishables Cool

If you decide to ship perishable foods, they should be kept below 40°F during shipping. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service, known as FSIS, recommends using a cold source, such as dry ice, to help keep food items cold. Additionally, packing items in an insulated cooler or with corrugated cardboard for insulation may help keep the contents cold longer. Keep in mind that precautions are needed when using dry ice so that it doesn’t come in contact with bare hands or the food that’s being shipped. It’s also a good idea to alert the recipient by writing “Contains Dry Ice” on the box.

To help minimize the time foods spend out of refrigeration, write “Keep Refrigerated” on the outside of any cold storage boxes before mailing them. Ship items that need refrigeration at the beginning of the week, so they aren’t sitting at the shipping facility over the weekend. Notify the person you’re sending the package to, so they know when it’s expected to arrive.

Inspect Upon Arrival

If you receive a shipment, immediately open any package marked ""Keep Refrigerated"" to check the temperature of the food items inside. Perishable food should arrive frozen or at least partially frozen with little ice crystals or below 40°F.

Use a food thermometer to test the perishable food when it arrives. If it's above 40°F, immediately notify the shipping company and do not eat the food.

Whether you're shipping the food item to a home, dorm room or workplace, alert the recipient that a gift is in the mail so somebody can receive it. Don't deliver it to an office unless it will arrive on a workday and your recipient has access to refrigerator space.

Thawing is primarily used for frozen meats, poultry and seafood. Most vegetables can be cooked without thawing. It is important to follow these guidelines to thaw foods safely because bacteria can multiply rapidly when food is left out of the refrigerator for more than two hours — and only one hour, if the temperature is hotter than 90 degrees Fahrenheit.

How To Thaw

There are three safe methods to thaw frozen foods:

1. In The Refrigerator:

Plan ahead. Most items can take an entire day (or overnight) to thaw.

Place frozen food on a plate or in a container to catch any juices that may leak.

Keep the item that’s thawing on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator.

Any food that’s been thawed in the refrigerator can be refrozen, either before or after cooking.

2. In Cold Water:

This is a faster thawing method compared to thawing in the refrigerator. However, it could take a couple of hours, depending on the food's weight.

Put the frozen item in a watertight plastic bag or container.

Submerge the item in cold water.

Make sure to change the water every 30 minutes.

Cook immediately after thawed.

You must fully cook all foods thawed with this method, before refreezing them.

3. In The Microwave:

Remove any plastic or outer wrapping on the package.

Place in a microwave-safe container and cover.

Follow your microwave's instructions to defrost.

Cook immediately after thawing.

You must fully cook all foods thawed in the microwave before refreezing.

Cooking Without Thawing

If you don't have enough time to thaw food before cooking, it is safe to cook foods from a frozen state — but your cooking time will be approximately 50% longer than for foods that are fully thawed.Most frozen vegetables can be cooked without thawing. Cook them in ½ cup or less of water, drain and then season with your favorite herbs and spices.",home-food-safety

Go Lean with Protein

Choose options that are lower in saturated fat, such as lean cuts of beef and pork, skinless poultry or fish.

Switch things up with ground turkey burgers. Turkey burgers can be as lean as 99% fat-free. Boost flavor by adding cilantro, shallots or chili sauce to spice things up. Or, mix in feta cheese, Kalamata olives, oregano and pepper and serve on a pita with fresh tomatoes and cucumbers for a Greek-style burger. Just remember to use a food thermometer to ensure ground turkey reaches a safe internal temperature of 165°F.

Alternatively, grill tofu, tempeh or bean-based burgers as vegetarian and vegan options.

Roast Veggies

Baste vegetables such as red peppers, corn on the cob, eggplant, summer squash, sweet potatoes, cherry tomatoes, mushrooms or onions with olive oil and season with herbs.

Place directly on a hot grill (or a piece of tin foil) until they are tender and brown.

Surprise guests with grilled marinated Portobello mushrooms. Marinate mushrooms in balsamic vinegar, olive oil, garlic, whole ground mustard and fresh herbs for about 30 minutes. Grill mushrooms for about 5 minutes on each side. Serve with tomato and onion slices, lettuce, and with or without toasted bun.

Try These Easy  Salads

Make caprese. Slice tomatoes and layer a small, thin piece of mozzarella cheese and fresh basil on each tomato slice, sprinkle with olive oil and lightly salt.

Combine fresh fruit with fennel. Thinly slice fresh fennel and let it soak in freshly squeezed lemon juice for 20 minutes. Toss sliced peaches into fennel and add rice vinegar, lemon zest and a light sprinkling of salt and pepper.

Whip up a quick avocado salad. Cube avocados and toss with vinaigrette, fresh herbs, capers, sliced green onions and roasted pine nuts.

Grill Up Dessert

Cook fruit kabobs, pineapple slices or peach halves on low heat until the fruit is hot and slightly golden for a tasty and nutritious dessert.

Grill watermelon for 30 seconds on each side to bring out more flavor. You also could carve out a watermelon to use as a bowl for fruit salad!

Marinate strawberries in balsamic vinegar for 30 minutes, toss in fresh mint and serve a refreshing savory dessert.

Step 1: Make a Menu.

First, think about your approach to meal planning — do you:

Want to make a weekly or a monthly plan?

Prefer to prepare meals ahead of time, just before the meal or a combination of both?

Want to pick a day to cook meals for the week or a month that you can store in the freezer?

Need to consider any special nutrition needs for yourself or your family?

Next, either on a sheet of paper, in your phone or on the computer, create your menu:

Take a minute to read about how to put together a healthy mealand make sure you are getting theright amount of each food group.

Flip through cookbooks or online sites and findrecipesthat appeal to you.Evaluate the level of cooking skill required to make the recipe. Do you have those skills? If not, are you up for the challenge? Also, make sure you have any specialcooking utensilsor pans needed for the recipe.

Check in with your family about their schedules and meal preferences.Weigh those factors as you put together your menu.

Think about the weather.Hearty soups and stews are ideal for a cold winter’s night. A salad with lean protein can make a perfect entrée on a hot summer day. If you are packing lunches, make sure any perishables can be stored in a refrigerator or in an insulated bag with an ice pack.

Find out what ingredients you already have on hand.It is best to continually rotate foodstuffs rather than store them for long periods of time. So, try to use up the items that you have on hand. You’ll also save money!

Check out the sales at your local supermarkets.Sometimes a discounted price can allow you to treat yourself and your family to a special meal. Remember: produce that is in season tends to be less expensive.

Aim for variety in meals; but, don’t feel like every day must be different.It’s OK to have oatmeal or low-fat yogurt with berries several times a week for breakfast. The same goes for lunch; pick a few options and rotate them across a week. Jot down breakfast, lunch and dinner options. And, don’t forget about snacks.

Think about how to handle leftovers.Might you serve them again that week or freeze them for another week? Remember to consider food safety, as refrigeratedleftoversshould be used within three to four days or frozen for later use.

Run the menu by others in your household.Does it look good to them? Make any adjustments needed.

During the week, keep notes about how well the menu worked.These notes can remind you of ways to improve your recipes and menu.

Step 2: Stock Your Pantry and Freezer with the Five Food Groups.

To help get started with meal planning, take time to stock up on the basics. This includes healthy foods that you like to eat and prepare. The lists below provide pantry and freezer items to stock up on from the five food groups. Circle the items you want to stock in your pantry and freezer. Plus, add other items based on your personal health needs and food preferences.

Five Food Groups Pantry List

Vegetables: Keep a variety of canned tomatoes in stock (diced, crushed, whole, stewed). Use them in soups, stews, sauces, casseroles and more! Also, pick up a jar of your favorite pasta sauce. Dried mushrooms are another great pantry item because they can add depth of flavor to your meals.

Fruits: Dried fruits such as raisins, dried cranberries and dried apricots provide dietary fiber. They also can add a punch of flavor to your morning breakfast, midday salad and dinner grains.

Milk and Dairy Products: Dried milk is a great back-up item to have on stock. You can use it in your coffee or tea. Boxed milk also is available in single-serving packages and is a great item for lunch boxes. Evaporated milk, available in cans in the baking aisle, can be substituted for liquid milk in most recipes.

Protein Foods:Stock up on canned or dried lentils and black, pinto, cannellini, garbanzo and kidney beans. These legumes are a great source of protein. Toss cooked beans in salads, soups, stews and other dishes. Canned tuna, anchovies and sardines are a pantry must — they are a quick way to add protein, healthy fats and flavor to meals.

Grains: Keep a stash of oatmeal, buckwheat and other whole-grain cereals in the pantry. For an extra boost, add nuts and fresh berries to these hot cereals. Barley, farro, quinoa and other grains are staples for healthy meals. Also, keep a variety of rice on hand — long grain, short grain, basmati and brown rice. Spaghetti, ziti, penne and other pastas are great for an easy, quick and filling family meal. Give yourself an extra nutrition boost by buying whole-grain pasta or trying pasta made from legumes.

Also, stock up on:

Condiments: Ketchup, mustard and relish can be stored in the pantry until opened. Once you open them, keep them in the fridge.

Oil and vinegar: Extra-virgin olive oil is a versatile, heart-healthy option. Other oils, such as peanut, walnut and sesame, add a burst of flavor to meals. Pick up different types of vinegar, such as cider, white and balsamic. Each imparts a unique flavor to your recipes.

Stock: Vegetable, chicken and beef stock are the basics of many recipes. Opt for low-sodium versions or ones with no added salt.

Herbs and spices: Pick up small containers of groundherbs and spices. That way they are as fresh as possible when you use them.

Flax and other seeds:Flax and chia seeds deliver protein, dietary fiber and omega-3 fatty acids. Add them to cereal, salads, sauces and home-baked goods. If you buy whole flaxseed, make sure you grind it up before eating so your body can absorb the nutrients.

Five Food Groups Freezer List

To help make sure you don’t store food beyond freshness, put dates on the packages before storing in the freezer. And, use the oldest first.

Vegetables:Pick up some of your favorite frozen veggies. These are a great source of vitamins, minerals and other nutrients because the flash-freezing process locks in the nutrition. Look for packages without sodium. And, while you are in the produce aisle, grab some fresh herbs. When you get home, fill ice cube trays with chopped herbs, top off the herbs with boiling water, and carefully place in the freezer. Add these herb cubes as you prepare meals for a punch of freshness.

Fruits: Stash frozen berries and other fruits in the freezer. They are a great way to add nutrition to a morning smoothie.

Milk and Dairy Products:Freeze Parmesan and other pre-shredded cheeses — toss them into soups, stews and pasta dishes. Low-fat frozen yogurt can be a quick dessert for a special occasion.

Protein Foods:Stock up on salmon and other fatty fishes to ensure you have ready access to healthy fats. Lean meats and poultry also store well in the freezer. One tip: Make sure you move it to the refrigerator one day before cooking to give adequate time for defrosting. Keep a variety of nuts in the freezer. This helps prevent them from spoiling. Add them to cold cereal, salads, hot grains and other dishes.

Grains: Whole-grain corn tortillas freeze well and can be used for quick breakfasts, lunches or dinners. Can’t eat that loaf of bread fast enough while it is fresh? Make it a habit to freeze part of the loaf and defrost slices as you need them.

Step 3: Keep a Running Grocery List.

Keep a pen and pad of paper somewhere convenient and, as you use up grocery items, write them down on the list. This way, you don’t have to worry about forgetting anything when you go grocery shopping. Or, use an app for that!

There are many grocery shopping apps available for both iOS and Android platforms. Some apps even include information on where to get the best deals on food prices. For example, after you enter your list, the app might suggest which local supermarket has the best prices for those items. Others allow you to sort your list into categories for ease of shopping. And, meal planning options also are special features of some apps.

On your list — be it paper or app-based — compile the needed ingredients for the meals you plan to make for the week. Also, think about how often you are able and want to shop. Plus, think about your plan for meals and check to see what ingredients you already have and what items you need. Remember to check the cabinets, pantry, fridge and freezer. Ideally, you want to continually use what you have on hand so that your meals are made with fresh ingredients — and also help reduce food waste.",planning

Cruciferous veggies are a diverse group that includes broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kale, bok choy, arugula, Brussels sprouts, collards, watercress and radishes. Fun fact: The term “cruciferous” is an informal classification for members of the mustard family and comes from the Latincruciferaemeaning “cross bearing,” because the four petals resemble a cross.

While these veggies grow in all different colors, shapes and sizes, they share several nutritional benefits. Most cruciferous vegetables are rich in vitamins and minerals such as folate and vitamin K. Dark green cruciferous veggies also are a source of vitamins A and C and contain phytonutrients — plant-based compounds that may help to lower inflammation and reduce the risk of developing cancer. Cruciferous vegetables are rich in fiber and low in calories, a combination that will help you feel full and satisfied without overeating.

It doesn’t take much to reap the benefits. Adults need at least 2½ cups of vegetables per day. One cup of raw and cooked veggies, such as broccoli, cauliflower and Brussels sprouts, is equivalent to a 1-cup vegetable serving. Two cups of raw leafy vegetables, such as kale and arugula, are the equivalent of a 1-cup vegetable serving.

Ready to add more cruciferous veggies into your diet? These tips will make packing in your vitamins and minerals easyandenjoyable.

Cauliflower

This versatile veggie is delicious in many ways beyond steaming. Try roasting florets or “steaks” of cauliflower to release its pleasant flavor. When pureed, it’s a great substitute for cream sauce. Other creative cauliflower options? Mash into a pizza orquiche crust, grate it into a substitute for rice or pickle it for a low-calorie salty, crunchy snack.

Brussels Sprouts

Brussels sprouts practically beg to beroastedin the oven. For a melt-in-your-mouth side dish, roast and toss with something sweet, such as dried fruit or maple syrup, as well as something savory — anything from Parmesan cheese to sliced olives.

Kale

The almighty kale is a wonderful green forsalads. Remove the tough stem, slice into thin ribbons and toss with toppings and dressing. Best of all, this hearty green will not wilt for days, making it a great option for preparing in advance. To balance the bitter bite, pair it with something sweet such as roasted carrots, diced apple or dried fruit. Kale also is a great addition to smoothies,soupsand can even be baked into crisp chips.

Arugula

Arugula is one of the easiest greens to grow in your garden or in a planter. Enjoy this spicy leaf pureed into a pesto with a kick, tossed onto whole-wheat pizza once it emerges from the oven or used in a variety oftossed salads. For a classic combination try fresh arugula paired with feta cheese, cubed watermelon and a balsamic dressing.

Broccoli

Broccoli lends itself to a variety of recipes, from crunchysaladsto creamysoups. It can be steamed with grated cheese on top or eaten raw with dip. For picky eaters, try finely chopping broccoli and baking it intonuggets.

Cabbage

Purple, green, savoy or Napa – there’s a variety of cabbage and different types work best in different recipes. Green, purple and Napa cabbage work well inslaws. Red or purple cabbage are great forbraisinguntil tender. Savoy and green cabbage are popular choices for stuffing with meat or other ingredients and baking.

Bok Choy

Available in both standard and “baby” sizes, bok choy is a vegetable that steams quickly. Try adding it toward the end of the cooking process to help it keep its crunch. Bok choy makes a great addition to soups andstir-fry, or try it sauteed as a side dish with garlic or ginger sauce.",food-groups

Kitchen Surfaces

Use hot soapy water to clean kitchen surfaces after preparing each food item. Wipe down your appliances, countertops, utensils and cutting boards. Keeping cutting boards and surfaces clean helps prevent cross-contamination that could cause food poisoning. To sanitize dishwasher-safe materials, use a high temperature setting and drying cycle.

For items that can't be run through the dishwasher, such as large cutting boards or appliances, sanitize with a mixture of 4 teaspoons of unscented liquid chlorine bleach in 1 quart of water.

Sponge and Dishtowel Safety

Dishcloths and sponges are the cleaning tools of choice for many Americans. Help keep them clean by following these dos and don'ts.



Clean Sponges DailyMicrowave damp sponges for one minute or put them in the dishwasher with a drying cycle to help reduce bacteria and other harmful microorganisms.





Don't Be a ScroogeMany of us keep sponges until they look dirty or smell bad. Some of us even wait until sponges fall apart before throwing them out. And, a few of us keep using the same sponges for weeks or even months.Be sure to throw out used, smelly sponges. And don't wait until they're falling apart to get a new one.



Start a New CycleWash dishtowels and dishcloths frequently. Put them in the hot cycle of your washing machine and dry thoroughly on a high setting.



Don't Use Sponges to Wipe Up Meat JuicesCleaning up spills with a sponge can increase your chances of spreading harmful foodborne pathogens.

Instead, use a paper towel or disinfectant wipes to clean up spills from ground beef or poultry.



Replace FrequentlyEven after two or three uses, your sponge may be teeming with bacteria. Replace it regularly.If your sponge starts to smell at any point — toss it out immediately.



Don't Use Sponges on CountertopsSponges may contain millions of bacteria. And, it only takes a few to get you sick.Using a paper towel or disinfectant wipe to clean countertops will help reduce the chances of spreading germs with your sponge.



Don't Ignore DishclothsBe sure to launder dishcloths frequently as they can harbor enough harmful bacteria to make you sick.Washing in hot water and drying them on high heat in the dryer is recommended. And, consider having separate dishcloths for different purposes (for example, hand-washing and dish drying). Different colored towels can help; for example, use blue for hands and green for the counter.

Why Skip Out on Breakfast?

All households have their reasons. In some cases, getting kids up and out the door on time takes all the energy their parent or caregiver can muster at that hour of the day. Perhaps others may have financial issues that make obtaining nutritious food a challenge. And there may be kids who, like many adults, just find it difficult to eat first thing in the morning.

The Good News

Many schools throughout the country participate in theUSDA's School Breakfast Program, a program modeled after theNational School Lunch Programto provide nutritious breakfasts to students at participating schools. Participation climbs yearly — about 100,000 schools and institutions currently offer school breakfast. In 2022, approximately 15.3 million children participated in school breakfast on any given day. A large majority receive their meals free or at a reduced price.

According to the USDA, school breakfasts must meet the applicable recommendations of theDietary Guidelines for Americansand are designed to ensure that students enter the classroom well-nourished and ready to learn. While types of food vary because specific nutritional guidelines must be met, children can expect a milk; 100% juice or fruit and/or vegetable; a grain- or whole grain-based product such as cereal, toast or waffles; and sometimes hot options such as eggs or meat or meat alternative. Schools that provide breakfast in the classroom to all students have shown decreases in tardiness and suspensions, as well as improved student behavior and attentiveness.

The Better News

There are criteria in order to qualify for free or reduced meal programs, but some schools have increased participation by offering free breakfast to all kids in the classroom. If you qualify for reduced or free breakfast, it's a good idea to take advantage of the program.",planning
Blanch Before You Freeze,https://www.eatright.org/food/home-food-safety/safe-cooking-and-prep/blanch-before-you-freeze,"Contributors:Esther Ellis, MS, RDN, LDN

Reviewed:February 25, 2020","Freezing is a great way to preserve foods. But when it comes to freezing fresh produce, there is more involved than just putting foods directly into the freezer. One solution to this problem is to blanch vegetables before you freeze them. Blanching reduces enzyme action in food, which helps vegetables retain their color and flavor.

Note: Blanching is great for many vegetables and some firm fruits, such as apples and pears. Other foods, such as meat, don’t need to be blanched before freezing.

What is Blanching?

Blanching is a process where food is exposed to boiling water or steam for a brief period and then quickly placed in ice water to prevent it from cooking all the way through.

The amount of time needed to blanch different vegetables varies. And, it is important to follow the recommended times for specific vegetable because over-blanching leads to a loss of flavor, color and nutrients, whereas under-blanching can increase enzyme activity. Check the blanching chart below for the appropriate blanching times.

Why Blanch?

Here are a few reasons to blanch vegetables:

Blanching helps to preserve the flavor, color and texture of fresh produce that’s being frozen.

Blanching helps slow the loss of vitamins.

Blanching helps cleanse the surface of dirt and some bacteria.

How To Blanch?

There are two major steps involved in blanching foods. First, the vegetables must be submerged in boiling water. Second, they must be cooled quickly.

For every pound of vegetables, use at least one gallon of water to blanch them in. Leafy green vegetables require twice as much water – so two gallons of water for every one pound of leafy green. Before blanching, wash vegetables and remove the peels or skins if desired. If you plan on freezing your vegetables sliced, chopped or cut, do this before blanching.

When the water is boiling, just add the vegetables to the pot and cover tightly. The water should return to boiling within a minute of adding the vegetables. As soon as water returns to a boil, the blanching countdown begins. To help remove the vegetables quickly and easily when they’re ready, place the vegetables in a wire basket or secure them in cheesecloth before boiling them.

Vegetables should be cooled quickly and thoroughly to stop the cooking process immediately after blanching. To do this, plunge the vegetables into a large bowl of cold water, 60 degrees Fahrenheit or below. Change the water frequently or use one pound of ice for each pound of vegetables to help keep the water cold. It should take about the same amount of time to cool vegetables as it did to blanch them. Drain vegetables in a colander after they’ve cooled and lay flat on a clean towel or paper towels to let them fully dry. Extra moisture can reduce quality when vegetables are frozen.

Pack your blanched vegetables in food safe, plastic freezer bags or rigid containers before storing in the freezer. Allow some extra space in the container before sealing, as some items may expand when frozen.

Below are tips to keep in mind when shopping for your next bunch of grapes or head of lettuce.

Buying

When at the farmers market, go early to avoid produce that has been sitting out all day.

In grocery stores, if you are not satisfied with the store's selection, ask the supermarket’s produce manager if there is more produce available.

Buy loose produce rather than prepackaged items for more control over what you select.

While oddly shaped produce is fine to eat, avoid produce with mold, bruises or cuts.

Select only the amount of produce that you will use within a week to reduce the chance of spoilage before you use it.

Storing

Promptly store fruits and vegetables that need refrigeration.

Note that some fresh, whole produce does not need to be refrigerated (such as bananas or potatoes). For other produce, refrigeration may lengthen the shelf life (such as with apples or cucumbers) or prevent rapid spoilage (berries and mushrooms).

If fresh produce has been peeled or cut, refrigerate within two hours and throw away any leftovers that have been left at room temperature for more than two hours.

Discard cooked vegetables after three to four days.

Preparing

Rinse fresh produce under cool, running water before eating or preparing. For items with tough skins, like potatoes or melons, use a produce brush to gently scrub the skin before peeling or cutting.

Cut away any damaged or bruised areas before preparing or eating. Remove and discard outer leaves of lettuce.

Dry produce with a clean cloth or paper towel to further reduce bacteria that may be present.

Use two separate cutting boards to avoid cross-contamination, use one for raw meats and the other for fruits and vegetables. Color-coded cutting boards can help you remember which is which.

4 Toddler Snacking Mistakes,https://www.eatright.org/food/planning/meals-and-snacks/4-toddler-snacking-mistakes,"Reviewers:Academy Staff RDNs
Published:March 21, 2019
Reviewed:May 17, 2024","Toddlers are notorious nibblers. Their small bellies mean they can't eat a lot at one time, and their go-go-go nature means they don't want to sit at the table too long. Snacking can help add needed nourishment into a toddler's day — as long as it's done right. Here are four strategies when it comes to snacks.

Strategy 1: Snacking On the Go

Many parents carry an arsenal of munchies to dole out when they're on the go. But too often, snacks are given to distract or occupy kids while running errands or on long drives, not because the kids actually need food. Grazing on the go also makes it hard for children to focus on their food and listen to their internal signals of hunger and fullness. Eating in the car can be risky, too. If your child chokes, you may not be able to help right away.

Smarter Strategy:Carry one or two small and easy snacks — such as a banana or small container of whole-grain crackers — in case hunger strikes while you're out. Try other distractions first (such as a book or small toy) when you need to buy time.

Strategy 2: Timing Is Everything

It's frustrating when toddlers come to the table at mealtime and don't want to eat. It's true that their appetites tend to fluctuate day to day, but snacking also may be to blame. Snacks before mealtime can make kids less receptive to trying new foods at meals. Toddlers also may learn to prefer ""snack foods"" — such as pretzels and gummy fruit snacks — over ""meal foods,"" which can make things even tougher.

Smarter Strategy:Space meals and snackstwo to three hours apart. If your toddler's hunger doesn't seem to match up with your mealtimes, consider moving meals earlier or serving your child a portion of the meal, such as the veggies, while you finish prepping.

Strategy 3: Make Snacks Nutritious

Many snack foods that are marketed to kids are full of refined flour, added sugar and salt. Those foods are OK to eat occasionally, but they don't provide the nutrients your child needs (such as calcium, iron and fiber) and they teach kids to associate ""snack"" with ""treat.""

Smarter Strategy:During most snack times, serve the same kinds of foods you serve at mealtime, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains including whole-wheat tortillas and bread, sources of protein such as hard-boiled eggs and hummus, and dairy products such as yogurt and cheese.

Strategy 4: Establish a Snack Schedule

Letting kids nibble all day not only ruins mealtime appetites, but also can set up unhealthy habits. Like adults, kids can learn to snack out of boredom. Mindlessly munching can lead to a pattern of overeating.

Smarter Strategy:Establish scheduled snack times. Most toddlers can go two hours between meals and snacks, so a mid-morning, mid-afternoon and evening snack may work well. Asking your toddler to wait may be tricky at first if munching on demand is the norm. By sticking to dependable meal and snack times, your child will feel reassured that there are plenty of opportunities to eat.",planning
Understanding Sustainability Labels on Restaurant Menus,https://www.eatright.org/food/planning/food-security-and-sustainability/sustainability-labels-on-restaurant-menus,"Contributors:Marissa Thiry, RDNPublished:August 28, 2023
Published:August 28, 2023","Food systems play a significant role in total greenhouse gas emissions — gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to climate change. With the rise of consumer interest in protecting the environment and desire to purchase from companies that have sustainable practices, restaurants are exploring ways to minimize their impact on the environment and let consumers know about these efforts. Some restaurants use sustainability-related labels or terms on their menus to indicate a more climate-friendly offering. However, a lack of consistent regulations and standard language can lead to many different approaches at restaurants, causing consumer confusion or misinterpretation.

How restaurants are creating more climate-friendly offerings

When it comes to sustainable menu offerings, a few common approaches include:

Sourcing Sustainably. Many restaurants are evaluating their carbon footprint across their entire supply chain, including how and where their food is grown, harvested, processed and transported before it gets to the restaurant. A few ways restaurants can source sustainably include properly caring for animals raised for food, minimizing deforestation commonly caused in certain supply chains, supporting food providers by purchasing from reputable sources, and buying locally grown or raised products to reduce emissions from long-distance transportation.

Offering Choice and Variety on the Menu. Where and how an animal is raised for food can affect its level of environmental impact. Cattle, due to their large population, size and particular digestive characteristics, account for most emissions from livestock in the United States. This is partly because of the number of cattle, which produce methane through digestion, as well as the overall land and resources involved in cattle production to make beef products and cow’s milk. Therefore, many restaurants feature plant-based (containing no animal products) or plant-forward (containing less animal products) menu items as climate-friendly offerings. Additionally, some restaurants may utilize less common or leftover parts of an animal or vegetable scraps to minimize food waste going to landfills.

How some organizations are helping

The Federal Trade Commission has published a resource calledGreen Guidesthat provides definitions and guidance for various environment-friendly claims used in marketing. While the guide is a useful tool for restaurants, it does not carry the same weight as federal or state regulations when it comes to compliance. Regulations for sustainability claims may differ from state to state, causing confusion when comparing with the content inGreen Guides.

The World Resources Institute, a global research organization that creates sustainable solutions for various organizations, developed the Coolfood Meals menu program, which flags menu items that are below a specific emissions threshold.

The United States Department of Agriculture regulates and defines certain claims and terms for products that fall under the department’s jurisdiction, such as meat and poultry products and the use of animal welfare claims. Since these definitions are regulated — not an optional tool or guidance — compliance to these claims is more clear and common.

Sustainability-related labels or terms restaurants use

The FTC’sGreen Guidesidentifies 14 categories of environmental marketing claims. While these claims span all industries, some of the most common food-related claims include general environmental benefit claims (for example, “eco-friendly,” “green,” and “saves the planet”) and carbon offsets claims (for example, “carbon negative”).

Many companies use claims not currently included inGreen Guides, such as emissions claims (such as “net zero,” “carbon neutral,” and “low climate impact”) to indicate the amount of greenhouse gas (most commonly carbon) emissions that are released into the atmosphere in the process of creating a menu item; origin claims (for example, “locally grown” or “locally sourced”); or animal welfare claims (such as “humanely raised,” “raised without antibiotics or hormones,” and “grass-fed”).

These and other menu labels for sustainability are meant to help people make educated food choices. However, these claims are often unregulated and used voluntarily. Add to that the lack of consistent language and varying approaches from one restaurant to the next, and it can be quite confusing for people dining out. If you are unsure about what a menu label or claim means, consider reaching out to the restaurant for clarification so you can make an informed decision.",planning

TheDietary Guidelines for Americansrecommend filling half your plate with vegetables and fruit. Here are some tips on how you can add more produce to your meals:

Keep frozen, canned and dried fruit and vegetables on hand, especially when fresh produce isn't in season. Buy canned fruit that's packed in 100% juice to reduce added sugars and extra calories, and choose low-sodium or no salt added canned vegetables.

Try new types of fruits and vegetables and prepare them in different ways. Texture is everything when it comes to sandwiches, so experiment with veggie toppings such as raw cucumber, avocado slices or pickled carrots. Add flavor to breakfast by topping oatmeal, frozen waffles or cereal with berries or banana slices. Create a naturally sweet dessert with fresh fruit or serve it as a topping on low-fat yogurt.

In the United States, a large portion of fruit intake comes from juice, which can often contain a significant amount of added sugar. Instead, try to focus on whole fruits, which contain dietary fiber and other nutrients without the added sugar. When drinking juice, make sure it is 100% juice, without the added sugars.

Make it fun.Presentation is everything when serving party foods. It helps to include a variety of colors and make eating a hands-on experience. Try cutting finger foods, such as mini sandwiches or melon, into fun shapes using cookie cutters, serving kebabs and providing dips and other interactive foods to keep kids engaged.

Choose nutritious time-saving foods.When it comes to quick-and-easy options, go for air-popped popcorn, whole-grain tortilla chips with salsa, bean dip or guacamole, or whole-wheat pita bread with hummus. Toss together a simple trail mix made with whole-grain cereal, nuts and dried fruit for an energizing mix of complex carbohydrates and protein. If you are serving a meal at your child’s party, consider ordering from a local restaurant as many cater and can provide a balanced spread. Some ideas: tacos, sub-style or mini sandwiches and baked chicken nuggets.

Build a colorful fruit and vegetable tray.Aim for a variety of colors and textures on fruit and vegetable trays. Try combining watermelon slices, tangerines, grape tomatoes, baby carrots, steamed and chilled green beans and cauliflower florets. Including a variety of colors ensures kids are getting a range of nutrients. Serve with hummus, ranch or yogurt dip.

Include a filling main event.For a protein-packed finger food, prepare mini meatballs with lean ground beef or turkey. Serve on toothpicks with a tomato-based sauce for dipping. Or have a homemade pizza party and turn the food prep into a party activity — kids like to eat what they create. Make do-it-yourself personal pizzas using whole-wheat English muffins or pita bread for crust. Provide lower-sodium marinara sauce, low-fat cheese, turkey pepperoni and plenty of fresh vegetables.

Serve a hydrating drink.Instead of soda or other sweetened beverages, serve fruit juice mixed with sparkling water for a bubbly drink with less sugar, or try infusing water with fresh fruit, such as strawberries, oranges or lemons.

Be smart with sweet treats.Serve mini-cupcakes or serve each child individually, rather than leaving sweets out for the taking. Nutrient-dense options include fruit- or yogurt-based popsicles.

After the party goodies.Take-away goodie bags are common at children's birthday parties.

This means plenty of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nonfat or low-fat dairy, and lean protein foods to provide them with the nutrients they need. The secret to feeding a healthy family is to serve delicious nutrient-rich foods at every meal and snack.

Here are some quick and easy ways to serve children high-octane choices from every food group, morning, noon and night.

Whole-Grain Foods

Whole grains pack a variety of nutrients, including dietary fiber, B-vitamins, and their carbohydrate provides fuel for young bodies to grow and keep active.

In recent years, there has been a surge of new grain products on grocery shelves. With so many options, it's hard to know which ones to pick. Choose items that list whole grains as the first ingredient on the label. Offer kids items like whole-grain hot or cold cereals for breakfast, kid-friendly ""white"" whole-wheat bread for sandwiches, crunchy whole-grain crackers for snacks and whole-grain pastas for dinner. To add variety, try quick-fix whole grains such as quinoa, whole-wheat couscous and quick-cooking brown rice on their own or mixed with other foods.

Fruits and Vegetables

You can’t go wrong with fruits and vegetables: fresh, frozen, canned, dried and 100% juice. Fruits and vegetables provide a variety of vitamins and minerals, like vitamins A, C, potassium, and dietary fiber.

For kids and adults alike, eating more fruits and vegetables at every meal is important for health. At breakfast, enjoy fresh or frozen berries on cereal or in a smoothie, slices of melon, a glass of 100% juice, or veggies mixed into eggs; at lunch, serve crunchy baby carrots or sliced apples; for dinner, put brightly colored vegetables (broccoli, corn, sliced peppers, frozen peas or leafy green salad) at the center of every plate. Juice is a delicious way to get valuable nutrients; but it can’t replace the benefits of eating whole fruits and vegetables, so get at least half of fruit choices from whole fruit.

Low-fat Dairy Foods

Dairy foods provide protein, calcium, potassium, magnesium and phosphorus – all of which are important nutrients for kids. Although, most young people in America are not getting enough calcium or potassium. Fortunately, it's easy to consume the three daily dairy servings to get the nutrients that children and teens need. There are many nutrient-rich, low-fat dairy products to choose from: an 8-ounce glass of low-fat milk with breakfast, lunch and dinner; fat-free or low-fat yogurt parfaits for breakfast or an after-school snack; or string cheese for an on-the-go energy snack. Non-dairy sources of these nutrients include fortified soy milk, soy yogurt and calcium-set tofu.

Lean Meat, Poultry, Fish, Eggs, Beans or Nuts

Whether it's growing muscles or active brains, in addition to the protein in these foods, this group provides iron, zinc and B-vitamins - nutrients crucial for children. Getting enough protein at every meal and snack helps with extending satiety (feeling comfortably satisfied after eating).

While most kids eat plenty of protein at lunch and dinner, they don't necessarily get the protein they need at breakfast or snacks. Options like eggs, yogurt and breakfast burritos work well in the morning. For snacks, nuts, peanut butter or other nut butters, hummus or other bean dips are great options",planning

Seder dinner occurs on the evening of the 15th day of Nisan in the Hebrew calendar, which occurs in March or April, depending on the year. Family and friends gather at the ritual meal of Passover Seder to retell the story as written in the Jewish text called the Haggadah.

Because the Israelites did not have time for their bread to rise when they were freed from Egyptian slavery, all food deemed “hametz,” or prepared with five types of grain (wheat, barley, oats, spelt and rye) that has been allowed to leaven, is prohibited. Although these grains are generally avoided, matzo, which is made from flour, is allowed as it’s supervised from either the time of wheat harvest (matzo shmurah), or from the time the wheat is ground to ensure it never meets with water or moisture, as this can cause it to leaven.

Amid the biblical food restrictions, notable foods are required during the Passover Seder. Strategically placed on the table or on the “Seder plate,” these foods have symbolic meaning, helping members of the Seder relive the story of the Exodus. Representative Seder foods include:

The roasted shankbone,za’roah, which symbolizes the lamb that was sacrificed. It is a remembrance of God’s outstretched hand that redeemed the Israelites from Egyptian slavery. After the telling of the Passover story, the shankbone is divided into small pieces so each guest of the Seder can have a taste.

Beitzah, an egg that’s been hard-boiled and roasted, represents the Passover offering and continued existence. Depending on different customs, it is consumed after the telling of the Passover story.

Maror, bitter herbs such as horseradish, are meant to serve as a reminder of the enslavement of the Israelites. There are designated times throughout the Seder when these foods are consumed.

Thecharosetsymbolizes the brick and mortar the Israelites created. It is a mixture of apples, nuts, sweet wine, cinnamon and sugar among the Ashkenazi tradition; or dates, nuts and sweet wine, according to the Sephardic tradition. The bitter herbs get dipped into thecharosetduring the Seder.

Karpas, greens such as parsley, symbolize spring, the time of year when Passover takes place. At a specific point during the reading of the Haggadah,karpasis dipped in salt water, reminiscent of tears the Hebrews shed while enslaved in Egypt.

Red wine is consumed as a symbol of redemption.

The matzo is arguably the most symbolic food eaten during the Seder. It represents the unleavened bread the Israelites baked since dough did not have time to ferment. Many types of matzo are available. From egg, spelt and whole-wheat to gluten-free oat varieties, matzo comes in all shapes and sizes to please any palate. Its grain-like taste, coarse texture and a hard crunch are its signature traits. Throughout the meal,matzot(plural of matzo) grace the Seder plate and are blessed, referenced in the Haggadah story and made into sandwiches with the charoset andmaror.

Main Event

Toward the end of the Seder, the main meal is served, typically at a late hour. The meal consists of traditional meat-based dishes and vegetable dishes such as roasted string beans. Depending on different customs, rice or potatoes may be included in the meal. It may come as a surprise that, although many ingredients to make cakes and other desserts are prohibited (for example, wheat flour), bakers get creative and whip up delectable cakes and cookies from ingredients such as almond meal, potato starch and cake meal (a very fine type of matzo meal).

Eating too much sodium can increase risk for high blood pressure which can eventually lead to heart disease, stroke and kidney disease. That's cause for concern since the average child consumes more than twice the sodium they need each day.

Choose Spices Over Salt

In the kitchen, think out of the box. Opt for spices instead of added salt. When you're cooking, reach for low-sodium seasonings such as fresh lemon or lime juice, fresh herbs or salt-free herb blends and vinegar to boost the flavor of your favorite foods.

Surprisingly, the salt we add during cooking and at the table accounts for little of our daily sodium intake. The main offenders are often packaged and processed foods.

Keep in mind that from a very early age, children's taste buds adapt to what they're used to eating.

Read Nutrition Labels

You can trim the sodium in your family's diet by carefully reading the Nutrition Facts Label when buying canned, frozen and packaged foods. Comparing brands and labels also can go a long way, as the amount of sodium in foods can vary from brand to brand by hundreds of milligrams.

Look for Foods Low in Sodium

It also helps to focus on foods that are naturally low in sodium. Eating more vegetables and fruit can help lower your sodium intake and increase your potassium intake. Produce contains little sodium, yet it's rich in potassium, a mineral that helps balance blood pressure. However, few of us get the potassium we require. Children ages 1 to 13 need roughly 2,000 to 2,500 milligrams of potassium a day, while teens and adults require 2,300 to 3,400 milligrams.

Top sources include vegetables such as potatoes, tomatoes and spinach and fruits such as bananas, oranges and avocados. For children to get the potassium they need, aim for eating at least 1 to 2 cups of fruits and 1 to 2½ cups of vegetables each day; teenagers should eat 1 to 2½ cups of fruit 1½ to 4 cups of vegetables per day.",planning

Store food in the right container, at the right temperature and for the right length of time. Proper food storage will reduce your risk of food poisoning and also help your money go further since your food won't spoil as quickly.

The cupboard is a great place to store your shelf-stable foods, from dry pasta to cookies.

Here are some tips on proper food storage in the cupboard:

Keep your cupboards and pantry clean, dry, dark and cool — preferably away from any heat-producing appliances. A cool temperature range, between 50°F to 70°F, helps keep foods at their best longer. When foods are stored at warmer temperatures (above 100°F) it tends to lower the quality of many foods, especially canned goods.

Organize your cupboards by placing older containers in front to use first. Canned foods have a long shelf life and, if stored properly, many unopened canned foods stay safe to use past their quality date on the can. For highly acidic foods, such as tomatoes and fruit, they may keep for as long as 12 to 18 months and less acidic foods, such as canned meats and vegetables, may last for two to five years.

Be alert for food spoilage and discard cans that are cracked, bulging, leaking or that spurt liquid when opened.

Most unopened dried fruits and vegetables can be stored in the pantry for six months to a year. After opening, use within one to three months or transfer to the fridge for a longer shelf life. For more information on how long foods last, check theFoodKeeper App.

After opening packages of dry foods, such as rice and pasta, store them in dry, airtight containers. This will help keep out insects and rodents and help prevent food from absorbing odors and moisture.

If you're confused by all the conflicting rules about what foods go where, don't fret: We have the inside scoop from registered dietitian nutritionists who are experts in food storage.

You're Getting Warmer: Foods to Store on the countertop or in the pantry

Honeyis very shelf-stable and will last a long time.  Also, if you chill honey it becomes hard to pour, so keep it in your pantry.

Tomatoesfare better when kept out of the fridge, where they can become mealy. It's true that they spoil faster when stored on the counter. If you won't be eating them within 1 to 2 days, store  ripened tomatoes in the refrigerator for 2 or 3 days. However, keep in mind that once you cut into a tomato (or any fruit or vegetable), it needs to be refrigerated to slow the growth of harmful bacteria.

Potatoes and Onionslike the same conditions, but they should not be stored together. Potato starch turns to sugar when refrigerated. Potatoes and onions should be stored in a cool, dry place such as the bottom of your pantry. Remove any potatoes and onions that go bad in the pantry from the rest.

Breadcan stale quickly in the fridge due to the dry circulating air. If you're afraid your bread will become moldy because your kitchen is hot or humid, or because you won't be eating it quickly, freeze it. You can remove only what you need and thaw it on the counter or in the toaster on the ""defrost"" setting.

Peanut butterbecomes difficult to spread when it's cold, so store it in your pantry if you will use it within 2 to 3 months. Store in the refrigerator for 4 to 6 months. However, if you buy natural peanut butter, check the label; some brands recommend refrigeration to keep the natural oils from separating.

Keep Your Cool: Foods that do better in the refrigerator

Olive oil and nut oilsgo rancid quickly when exposed to light and heat, which puts the kibosh on their healthful qualities. Refrigeration may cause these oils to become cloudy, but they'll clear up when they return to room temperature.

Cheesemay be best served at room temperature — but, like all animal-derived food, still needs to be stored in the fridge. Take it out a short time before serving for the best flavor. Perishable foods, including cheese, should be thrown out if they are kept out of the refrigerator for two or more hours. In the warmer months, that amount of time will be less.

Buttershould be kept cold. Your grandma may have kept her butter in a crock on the counter to keep it nice and spreadable. However, keeping butter refrigerated avoids risky bacterial contamination. If you want soft butter, remove it for a little while before serving to let it soften.",home-food-safety

Whether we're talking about blueberries, strawberries, blackberries or raspberries, these sweet, colorful fruits are sure to make your toddler or preschooler happy. Packed with antioxidants, dietary fiber and vitamin C, berries are a nutritional powerhouse.

The amount of fruit per day children need depends on their age, size and activity level. According to MyPlate, young kids (2 to 3 years) need 1 to 1½ cups per day of fruit. Older children (4 to 13 years) need up to 2 cups per day. Most teenagers also need 2 cups per day. Adolescent boys may need more — up to 2½ cups of fruit per day. Help them meet this goal by aiming to include fruit at each meal.

When Shopping

Look for containers at the store or farmers market without stains, moisture or mold. Berries should be firm, plump and dry. Strawberries don't ripen after harvest, so choose ones that are shiny and firm with bright red color. Choose blueberries that are firm, plump and dusty blue in color. Blackberries should be shiny but not leaking. Raspberries come in a variety of colors; make sure the ones you buy have the right color. For more fun, take your kids berry picking or grow berries at home. When buying frozen berries, shake the bag first. A big lump is a sign of defrost.

How to Store

When you get your bounty home, check for damaged berries and dispose of them immediately, before they spoil the rest. Strawberries, blueberries and raspberries last longer if stored at higher humidity with lower air circulation in the coldest place in your fridge. Produce drawers are ideal. If not available, a sealed container will do the job. Keep blackberries uncovered. While some types of berries can last up to two weeks in your refrigerator, most only last a few days. Eat them within three days for best quality and nutrition.

Preparing

Rinse berries in cold water just before you serve them. For younger children, cut up or mash berries to prevent choking. For older kids, try adding berries to low-fat yogurt, ice cream, whole-grain cereals, salads or smoothies. Fresh berries often taste best when in-season and may be frozen for later use.

Freezing

Freeze berries so you and your kids can enjoy them long after the season is over. Spread berries on a baking sheet and place in the freezer for a few hours, then transfer to a freezer-safe storage container.",food-groups

There's plenty to consider besides simply grabbing an energy bar or a bottle of water. Follow these tips to ensure you have a nourishing and safe food experience on your next outdoor adventure.

1. Have a Plan.

Your food and water needs are generally higher than usual on activity-based excursions. Pay extra special attention to packing plenty of fluids for outdoor adventures, especially if the weather is hot. Some other key considerations before your hiking or camping trip include:

Length of the trip

What foods and beverages you'll carry

How you'll eat and drink

If bringing a cooler is an option

What food-related tools you'll need

2. It's Essential to Stay Hydrated.

Pre-hydrate by drinking at least 4 cups of water before a hike so you have less to carry. Then, a good rule of thumb is to plan for about 2 cups of fluid for every hour of hiking. Make sure you can bring or access clean drinking water during your hike.

3. For a Hike or Day Trip...

You can pack perishable foods, such as sandwiches, just be sure you have a cold source (such as an ice pack) to keep foods properly chilled to below 40°F. The more you stash in a backpack, the harder it is to hike, so opt mainly for non-perishable foods that are relatively lightweight and nutrient dense, such as:

Trail mix

Nuts, seeds, nut-based bars or nut butter packs

Fresh, whole fruit that doesn’t require refrigeration such as apples, bananas and oranges

Dried or freeze-dried fruits and veggies

Energy bars, chews or gels

Granola or granola bars

Ready-made tuna salad pouches

Whole-grain tortillas or bagels

Shelf-stable, dried jerky, such as poultry, salmon or meat jerky

4. For Camping or Multi-Day Trips...

It's a little more challenging to pack food for days at a time. The first day you'll be able to eat perishable foods if you have a cooler; but after that, map out your meals so you'll have what you enjoy and need. Otherwise, include any of these shelf-stable, easily-packed basics to sustain you:

Easy-to-carry foods mentioned above

Ready-to-eat cereal

Fruit or vegetable puree in squeezable pouches (such as applesauce)

Poultry or fish pouches, or canned fish, poultry or meat in individual or regular servings

Individual packets of mayonnaise, mustard, taco sauce and/or soy sauce

Whole-grain pasta, couscous, rice mix, pancake mix, hot cereal, dried soups and dehydrated foods (if you have the ability to boil drinkable water)

Marshmallows — for a campfire dessert, of course

Safe drinking water, and possibly powdered beverage mixes

5. Don't Forget Proper Food Safety Practices.

Always follow good food safety practices — from packing to plating. Remember that perishable food cannot be safely kept out in hot weather (90°F or higher) for more than one hour or in mild weather for more than two hours. Otherwise, these foods become unsafe to eat and should be thrown out. Whether you’re hiking for a day or camping for a week, consider the following food safety essentials where applicable when packing for your next outdoor trip:

Disposable wipes, hand sanitizer or biodegradable soap

Bowls and plates

Kettle or cooking pot

Eating and cooking utensils

Can opener

Ice packs

Trash bags

Portable water filters or water purification tablets

Thermometers for cooler and cooked meat

And follow these food safety rules:

Wash hands often. This includes before and after eating. If you’re unable to wash your hands, using a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol may help reduce bacteria and germs.

If you bring raw meats to cook, keep them separate from ready-to-eat foods separate. Bring extra plates to keep these foods separate, too.

Cook foods to proper temperatures. Use a food thermometer to be sure cooked food has reached a safe internal temperature.

When possible, refrigerate promptly below 40°F. Of course, if you don't have a fridge, pack perishable food, including meat or poultry, with plenty of ice or ice packs in a well-insulated cooler to keep the temperature below 40°F. Store leftovers in small, clean covered containers in the cooler only if it still has ice. And keep the cooler in as cool a place as possible.

Since then, its observance has become permanent in four states, recognized by President Biden in 2021 and 2022, and proclamations for National Arab American Heritage Month have been issued by governors of 45 states and Congress.

According to theArab American Institute, there are approximately 3.7 million Arab Americans living in the U.S. While some people may confuse the terms “Arab” and “Middle Eastern,” these words are not interchangeable. Arabs are connected by a shared culture and history, not race. Arab countries include those within as well as outside of the geographical Middle East region such as Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia. The Middle East encompasses some non-Arab countries as well, such as Iran, Israel and Turkey. Each Arab country has its own distinct culture, history and Arabic dialect.

There are 22 Arab countries across the Middle East and North Africa: Algeria, Bahrain, the Comoro Islands, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Morocco, Mauritania, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon and Yemen. Most Arabs in the U.S. are of Lebanese, Syrian, Palestinian, Egyptian or Iraqi descent.

While Arab Americans can be found living across the entire United States, two-thirds reside in just 10 states: California, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia. The largest percentage of Arab Americans live in Dearborn, Michigan.

An integral part of American history, Arab Americans hold positions across all sectors including business, military, political and medical fields. This month and throughout the year, celebrate Arab Americans by learning more about their contributions, food and culture.

Culture and Religion

Many customs and food traditions are influenced by religion. Most people in the Arab world are Muslim, or people who follow Islam. However, in the U.S., around 65-70% of Arab Americans are Christian, namely Roman Catholic. Approximately 30-35% of Arab Americans in the U.S. are Muslim. However, recent years have seen an influx of Muslim Arabs immigrating to the United States, so these statistics may not be as representative of current numbers.

Christian Arabs have shared origins with Christianity, but there are some subtle differences depending on the specific church of Christianity, such as Coptic or Maronite.

Muslim Arabs observe two main holidays: Eid Al Fitr, a celebration to mark the end of fasting for the month of Ramadan, and Eid Al Adha, a commemoration to the pilgrimage to Makkah. Muslims eat foods that are halal, which means permissible to eat in Islam. However, the extent to which these guidelines are followed can vary based on cultural and family traditions. Meat that is halal means it is prepared according to Islamic law. Muslims abstain from all pork and its byproducts, as well as alcohol.

Food

Arabs are known for their generosity and hospitality, especially when it comes to food. Falafel, shawarma, hummus, baba ghanoush, fattoush and tabbouleh are just a few common foods in Arab cuisine. Variations of these dishes depend on the Arab region and traditional recipes passed down through generations.

Arab food staples include olives,labneh(strained yogurt dip), olive oil, za'atar, halloumi cheese, jam preserves,halaweh(also known ashalva, a sweet snack), fava beans, chickpeas, bread, dried dates, pine nuts and almonds, to name a few. Condiments include tahini, pomegranate molasses and date syrup. Spices and herbs are an important part of traditional Arab dishes and include sumac, cumin, oregano, seven-spice seasoning mix, parsley, mint and coriander.

Depending on the country of origin, popular dishes may include stuffed grape leaves,mahshee(stuffed zucchini and eggplant),freekehwith lamb meat,kabsehormansaf(rice with meat),kibbeh(fried stuffed bulgur and meat ball), grilled kabob and lamb tagine. Desserts includeknaffe(shredded phyllo dough with cheese),awwameh(fried dough balls) and baklava (layers of phyllo dough with walnuts) drizzled with a sugary syrup. No meal is complete without Arabic coffee, also known as Turkish coffee, or tea.

Arab Americans are an invaluable part of the mosaic of cultures in the United States. There is no better time to learn about and celebrate Arab Americans than National Arab American Heritage Month.

These simple steps make packing the perfect cooler a cinch:

Get a Head Start

Preparation starts before you actually pack your cooler. Think ahead the day before you plan to use it. If your cooler has been sitting in a hot attic or garage, bring it into the house so you can clean it and let it cool down.

When packing your cooler, use several inches of ice cubes or ice packs to keep your food cold. You also can make your own blocks of ice by filling clean, empty water bottles or milk cartons with water and freezing them overnight.

Arrange It Right

To keep food coldest — and safest — load food straight from the fridge into your cooler just before you leave the house, rather than packing it in advance.

Stashing food in watertight containers or zipped plastic bags keeps melting ice out and prevents juices from meat, poultry and fish from contaminating other foods. If you're serving a crowd, divide large portions of food into smaller servings and pack them in shallow containers to help them chill faster and make serving easier.

Pack items in the reverse order of when you’ll be using them. That way, the foods you eat last will still be cold when you're ready to serve them. The only exception is raw meat, poultry and fish; because their juices can drip onto other items, you should load them first so they are on the bottom of the cooler. Packing these items frozen can help keep your cooler temperature low even longer.

Keeping drinks in the same cooler as food means lots of opening and closing, which can quickly lower the cooler's temperature. Instead, pack a separate beverage cooler. Partially freezing bottles, cans and juice boxes prior to packing helps them stay frosty even longer.

Keep It Cold

While traveling, keep your cooler inside the car rather than in a hot trunk. At your destination, find a shady spot for your cooler so it doesn't bake in the sun. Covering it with a blanket, tarp or wet towel also can protect a cooler from sweltering temperatures. If you're at the beach, bury the bottom of the cooler in the sand and shade it with an umbrella.

One of the best ways to keep your food safe is to make sure the temperature inside the cooler is below 40°F. Instead of guessing, tuck an appliance thermometer inside for a foolproof reading.

To lock in cold air, keep the lid closed as much as possible. When you remove food, don't let it sit out for more than two hours maximum (or one hour on days when the temperature is above 90°F).",home-food-safety

Reviewed:December 22, 2023","Buffet and potluck-style gatherings are a convenient alternative to the traditional sit-down dinner. However, it’s important to take extra care when hosting because foods often sit out for long periods of time while guests snack and socialize, putting them at risk of the buffet blues — otherwise known as food poisoning.

Be the Host with the Most Food Safety Savvy

Lists help keep you organized, such as those for guests and groceries, yet one of the most important lists usually goes unwritten: a food safety checklist. These tips will help keep potluck and buffet meals fresh and safe for your guests to enjoy:

Keep it clean.Wash your handsbefore and after handling food, as well as between changing tasks, such as working with raw meat and then switching to produce. Serve food on clean plates and replace serving plates and utensils with clean ones when replenishing items. These steps are helpful in reducing the spread of bacteria and cross-contamination.

Monitor temperatures. Keep cold dishes cold (below 40°F) and hot dishes hot (above 140°F). When foods stay at a lukewarm temperature, they fall into thedanger zonewhere bacteria multiply more rapidly.

Always use a food thermometer to check the doneness of cooked foods. The only way to tell if a food is cooked to a safe level of doneness is by using afood thermometer. Make sure your food reaches a safe internal temperature before you serve it.

Transport food safely when traveling. Whether you’re serving the food you prepared somewhere else or having guests bring individual dishes, safely transporting food is part of the food safety process. Pack cold food items with ice in a well-insulated cooler or other container with cooling packs. In cold weather, transport the cooler in the trunk, which is the coolest part of the car in the wintertime. In warm weather, transport the cooler in an air-conditioned car instead of in a hot trunk. For hot items, pack in a well-insulated container and place them in the warmest part of your car. When you arrive, make sure to reheat foods to a safe internal temperature of 165°F.

Follow the two-hour rule. Perishable food can grow harmful bacteria quickly when left out of the refrigerator for more than two hours. If the temperature is warm (above 90°F), then the time limit is just one hour. To help avoid this buffet blunder and keep food out of the danger zone, set a kitchen timer as a reminder to place uneaten food back in the refrigerator before the time is up and to refresh your buffet table with new favorites every one to two hours. Any food left out beyond that time frame should be discarded. If guests are bringing food, keep in mind that the clock starts ticking when they walk out their door to come over.

Store hot foods in shallow containers to refrigerate or freeze them. This promotes rapid, even cooling throughout the food.

Don't Let These Bacteria Crash Your Get-Together

Bacteria is everywhere and can pass easily from hands to food. KeepStaphylococcus aureus,Clostridium perfringensandListeria monocytogenesaway from your buffets.

Staphylococcus aureus

Staphylococcus(""staph"") bacteria may live on the skin of healthy people without ever causing them to get sick but can spread and make other people ill through improper food handling. Prevention includes washing hands and utensils before handling food and not letting prepared foods — including cured meats and salads such as ham, egg, tuna, chicken, potato and pasta — sit at room temperature for more than two hours, or one hour if it’s warmer than 90°F.

Clostridium perfringens

C. perfringensis often found in raw meat and poultry, as well as foods served in large quantities and left at room temperature for long periods of time, for example buffets. To reduce risk, divide large portions of cooked foods such as beef, turkey, gravy, dressing, stews and casseroles into smaller portions for serving and cooling. Be sure to keep hot foods hot (above 140°F) and cold foods cold (below 40°F).

Listeria monocytogenes

Listeria bacteria can continue to multiply during refrigeration, which puts foods typically served cold at risk. Some foods that are already cooked, such as hot dogs and deli meat should be reheated to 165°F before serving, particularly forindividuals at high risk for foodborne illness. Stick with pasteurized dairy and milk products and keep the raw sprouts off the table, as these also come with a higher risk for Listeria.",home-food-safety
How to Get Your Kids to Eat Dark Leafy Greens,https://www.eatright.org/food/food-groups/vegetables/how-to-get-your-kids-to-eat-dark-leafy-greens,"Contributors:Esther Ellis, MS, RDN, LDN

Reviewed:September 17, 2024","There's a reason you hear so much about eating dark leafy greens. Vegetables such as kale, chard, collard greens, arugula and spinach are bursting with nourishing health benefits. However, many kids turn up their noses and are reluctant to eat them.

Discover how to prepare these nutritional superstars in ways that are healthy and appetizing.

The Nutritional Benefits of Greens

The 2020-2025Dietary Guidelines for Americansrecommends adults and children eat a specific amount of dark green vegetables each week, with the amount depending on their calorie needs. Individuals who need 2,000 calories a day should aim for 1½ cups of leafy green vegetables each week.

Nutrient-dense dark leafy greens are jam-packed with healthy plant-based compounds, plus lots of vitamins and minerals with just 10 to 25 calories per half-cup serving. The family of dark green leafy vegetables delivers many nutrients, such as vitamin A, vitamin C, antioxidants, dietary fiber, folate, vitamin K, magnesium, calcium, iron and potassium.

I Bought Leafy Greens — Now What?

Fresh greens can be stored in the crisper drawer of the refrigerator for three to five days. While some bagged greens from the grocery store are already washed, not every variety has been cleaned. For example, leafy greens from a farmers market may have dirt and sand in the leaves. To clean your greens, rinse under clean, running water and pat dry with towels.

Another cleaning option is a salad spinner, which can quickly clean and dry greens. You also canblanchlarge batches of greens and store them in the freezer for future use. For quicker cooking, remove the tough stems by folding a stack of leaves in half lengthwise and running a sharp knife along the stem.

4 Tips for Kid-Friendly Leafy Greens

People often get intimidated by cooking and eating darker varieties of greens due to their intense flavors. Try these tips for enhancing the flavor of different varieties to make them more enticing:

Overcome the bitterness of collard and mustard greens by braising them at a low temperature for an extended period of time, and seasoning them at the end of cooking. Remove the tough stems to reduce cooking time and avoid over-cooked greens.

For kale, be sure to choose the right variety. Tougher curly kale is best for adding to soups or stews or for braising. Tender lacinato and baby kale are best in salads.

Preserve nutrients by sautéing greens, rather than boiling. Sauté blanched greens with olive oil, onion and garlic to add flavor. Add chopped nuts for additionalheart-healthy fats. Sprinkle lemon zest over the sautéed greens to brighten the flavor. Do not use lemon juice as it will turn the leaves brown.

Make a salad with tender greens such as spinach or baby kale. To expose kids to dark greens, try tossing together a salad made half with familiar lettuce and half with a dark green one. Add a citrus-based dressing, which will help balance the strong flavor of the greens and aid in the absorption of iron found in the greens.",food-groups
Breasts vs. Thighs — Which Is More Nutritious?,https://www.eatright.org/food/food-groups/protein-foods/breasts-vs-thighs-which-is-more-nutritious,"Contributors:Sarah Klemm, RDN, CD, LDN

Published:March 19, 2021
Reviewed:August 26, 2024","Since the 1940s, the popularity of poultry, especially chicken, has been increasing in the United States. For some, this preference is due to health reasons. Poultry (without the skin) is often recommended as a substitute for red meat, since it is lower in saturated fat. Although leaner cuts of beef and pork are available.

There are many options when it comes to chicken. It's sold whole, as well as in parts like chicken breasts, thighs or wings and is available skinless and boneless. Price can be an influence when choosing a thigh over a breast, but taste and how the chicken is prepared can be considerations as well.

Tastier... But Is It Healthier?

Some people prefer the taste of dark meat over white meat and consider it to be more tender and flavorful.

Both chicken thighs and breasts are good sources of lean protein. However, they differ in the amount of calories, as well as total and saturated fat. For example, a 3-ounce skinless chicken breast provides about 140 calories, 3 grams of total fat and just 1 gram of saturated fat.

The same amount of dark chicken meat without the skin would provide a total of 9 grams of fat, 3 grams of saturated fat and 170 calories. This difference may not seem like much, but depending on the portion size, it can add up.

Another option is to choose dark turkey meat, which has fewer calories and fat compared to a chicken thigh. A 3-ounce portion has about 134 calories, 5 grams of total fat and 1.5 grams of saturated fat.

It's also a good idea to look at the Nutrition Facts Label. Some poultry products are injected with salt, which helps to keep it moist. Most Americans get too much salt from the foods they eat, so finding ways to reduce sodium by reviewing ingredients and the Nutrition Facts Label can help.

Cooking Counts, Too!

Of course, how the poultry is prepared will make a difference in the amount of calories and fat. Chicken and turkey can be baked, grilled, roasted or fried; seasoned, stuffed or coated with breading. Baking, grilling and roasting are considered healthier options, so look for these descriptions when eating out and limit all types of fried and deep-fried foods, including poultry. At home, keeping the skin on while cooking will help keep chicken and turkey moist and removing the skin before eating will help reduce calories and saturated fat.

Keep it Safe

No matter which type of poultry you choose to buy and prepare at home, remember to handle it properly. Raw chicken and turkey should not be rinsed before cooking, but be sure to wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling.

Chicken and turkey that is purchased frozen should be thawed on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator. Use separate utensils, containers and cutting boards for the raw and cooked foods. All poultry, regardless of the cooking method, should be cooked to a minimum internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit. Afood thermometerinserted into the thickest part will help determine if it's reached the appropriate temperature.

Storing foods safelyis also important and will help to reduce the risk of foodborne illness. Perishable foods, like poultry, should be refrigerated. After grocery shopping or meals, refrigerate poultry within two hours or within one hour if the temperature is above 90 degrees Fahrenheit. The same is true for leftovers when eating out, and they should be reheated to 165 degrees Fahrenheit and eaten within three to four days.",food-groups

Making nutritious food choices and working in physical activity throughout the day are two excellent ways to help keep your family's hearts beating strong.

Heart Healthy Foods

Fiberis great for heart health because it can bind with bad cholesterol and remove it from the body. Foods high in dietary fiber includewhole grains,vegetables and fruit. To increase your fiber intake from foods, include more plant-based sources of protein such as beans and peas, choose whole-grains whenever possible and make half your plate fruits and vegetables at each meal.

Low to moderate amounts of fat, specifically unsaturated fat, can also give heart health a boost. The unsaturated fats from foods such as nuts, olives, avocados and fatty fish can help increase good cholesterol levels. On the other hand, foods high in saturated fat should be limited, such as high-fat cuts of meat, butter and full-fat dairy products. Trans fat, also known as partially-hydrogenated oil, should be avoided.

Next time you are at the grocery store, pick up some of these heart-healthy items:

Beans, peas and lentils

Soybeans and tofu

Fruits and vegetables (fresh, frozen or canned without salt or added sugars)

Salmon, tuna, sardines and mackerel

Whole-grain breads, cereals and pasta, brown rice, barley

Nuts such as almonds, walnuts, pecans and hazelnuts

Move It

Another way to reduce your risk of heart disease is to be active.

Encourage pre-school aged children to engage in three hours of varied active play each day.

Children (6 years and older) and teens should get 60 minutes or more of physical activity each day, including aerobic activity as well as muscle and bone strengthening activities.

Adults should get at least two hours and 30 minutes of physical activity per week, includingmuscle strengthening activities.

Being physically active helps to lower blood pressure, manage stress and control weight. Be physically active in your own way and start with what you can - any physical activity is better than none.Reach your goals togetherby encouraging your family to take a walk after dinner, go for a bike ride or play a game of basketball.

Reviewed:February 19, 2025","Ever thought about how food gets from the farm to the supermarket and ultimately onto your plate? Whether it’s a plant-based or animal-based food, there’s a process that involves many systems including manufacturing and transportation, and it often involves countries around the world. Let’s explore plant-based and animal-based foods, including what they are, how they’re produced and where they come from.

Plant foods

Simply put, plant foods come from seeds. Some seeds can be eaten on their own, such as sunflower seeds, but most grow into plants. The edible portions of those plants are considered “plant foods.” Some plant foods grow on trees, while others grow on bushes or vines — some even grow underground or in the water.

Each variety of plant grows best in a specific climate, so it’s important that farmers know how to help each of their crops grow well. The United States produces a variety of crops such as corn, wheat and potatoes, but these (and other foods) are also grown throughout the world and may be sent to the U.S. during different times of year. Sometimes food travels far distances by train, airplane or cargo ships to get to your local store.

Some foods that come from plants include:

Beans and other legumes, such as peanuts and soy

Nuts and seeds, such as walnuts, almonds, pistachios and sesame

Fruits such as berries, peaches, plums, apples, pears, citrus and tropical fruit such as pineapples and bananas

Grains including rice, oats, quinoa, barley and wheat

Vegetables such as leafy greens, cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers, potatoes, carrots, corn, broccoli

Plant foods also may be used to make other products such as oil (for example corn, peanut, canola and avocado oils). Additionally, plant foods can be combined to create other commonly eaten foods. For example, wheat can be used to make pasta, crackers or bread, and rice can be used to make plant-based beverages, cereal or noodles.

Animal foods

Animal foods include any food that comes from an animal, such as milk or meat. Animals and other animal products are raised and processed on farms, factories and lots. Sometimes they are raised and slaughtered in the same location, while other times they are raised in one place, then shipped via truck or train somewhere else to be processed for food. Fish and shellfish can be caught in the wild or farmed in the ocean, rivers or tanks.

Some foods that come from animals include:

Dairy milk, yogurt and cheese

Eggs

Meat from land animals including cows, pigs and sheep

Poultry from chickens and turkeys

Fish and shellfish

Honey

Collagen or gelatin

Sour cream, butter, ice cream

Like plant foods, animal foods often are ingredients in familiar foods. Eggs are used to make noodles, cakes, cookies and baked goods, such as bread. Dairy products can be used to make chocolate and other desserts or incorporated into baked goods such as bread, muffins and croissants. Dairy is often included in salad dressings and sauces. Animal collagen is used to create gelatin, which is an ingredient in many puddings, gum and candy, among other foods.

Where in the world does food come from?

Although the United States imports (brings in) many foods, the country's diverse soils and environments allow us to grow and export (send away) many foods. In fact, in 2016, close to 90% of the food and beverage products consumed in America were produced in the U.S. According to the USDA, in 2021 the top five producing states were California, Iowa, Nebraska, Texas and Minnesota and the leading farm products in the U.S. were cattle, corn, soybeans, milk and other dairy products, chicken, pigs and wheat.

The U.S. sends food to other countries as well. In fact, 2022 was the highest export year ever for U.S. agriculture for food products. The top five areas the U.S. exports to include China, Mexico, Canada, Japan and the European Union. The United States also imports food from countries around the world. For example, barley, chickpeas and almonds may come from the Mediterranean region and West Africa. Soybeans may be imported from East Asia, and corn and avocados are often imported from Mexico and Central America.

Countries around the world, including the U.S., can influence the selection of foods that are available to consumers by participating in agricultural trade. Studies have shown that countries have relied on each other for up to 69% of the crops they use. This demonstrates a global connection that centers around food.",planning

To ensure your child's nutritious meal doesn't go to waste, you can encourage interest and appetites with a few of these simple strategies:

Sit down once a week and plan lunches together.Then encourage them to pack their own lunch. If kids have a vested interest in their lunch, they will be more likely to eat it. Let them watch you pack your lunch to set a good example.

Celebrate special days.Plan lunch menus around special events. For example, pack an all-red lunch in honor of Valentine's Day or include dumplings and spring rolls to celebrate Chinese New Year.

Try new foods.Bring your children to the grocery store to pick out some new fruits and vegetables. This will encourage an interest in trying new foods and may be helpful for picky eaters.

Add some veggies for a nutrition-packed lunch. Try mixing fruits and veggies together in one container, so a little sweet from the fruit rubs off on the veggies, such as sliced baby carrots mixed with a few raisins or dried cranberries or celery sticks with apple slices.

Switch up the same old sandwich routine.Try making sandwiches with mini whole-grain pitas, English muffins or tortillas for a fun change. Whole-grain cereals and whole-grain crackers also make for nutritious lunch options.

Invest in fun lunch containers.A quality insulated lunch bag in a fun print and insulated food container will enable your children to take a wider variety of foods for lunch, such as chilled pasta salad or warm soup. Also, remember to use an ice pack with their lunch to keep cold foods cold, reducing the risk of food poisoning.",planning

It is important to carefully select, package and transport food from the grocery store to home to keep it safe. Knowing how to select produce, dairy, meat and seafood can reduce your chance of foodborne illness. Follow these tips for a safe shopping experience.

Make Cleanliness a Priority

Check for cleanliness and only buy food from reputable businesses that follow food safety regulations. Determine the general impression of the facility and make sure it looks and smells clean.

Wipes are provided at many stores. Use these to clean hands and the handle of the shopping cart.

Clean hands before sampling food. Either bring moist towelettes or carry a bottle of hand sanitizer to use before you taste any samples.

If you use reusable grocery bags, wash them often.

Shop in Order

Gather non-perishable items first. Then, select refrigerated and frozen items.

Stop at the deli counter last. Place deli meats near the other cold items in your grocery cart.

Put fresh fruits and veggies on top of other foods in your cart.

Pick Your Produce

If you go to a farmers market, go early in the morning to avoid produce that has been sitting out all day.

Choose loose produce rather than packaged so you have more control over what you select.

Don’t purchase produce with mold, major bruises or cuts.

Purchase only the amount of produce you will use within a week.

Buy only pasteurized juices that have been kept refrigerated.

Inspect Food Packages

There should be no holes, tears or openings in food packages. Frozen foods should be solid with no signs of thawing. Refrigerated foods should feel cold.

Check safety seals. A loose lid on a jar means the vacuum has been lost and the product may be contaminated. Don't buy a food product whose seal seems tampered with or damaged. Report a defective cap to the store manager.

Avoid buying any cans that are deeply dented (one that you can lay your finger into), bulging, rusting or have a dent on either the top or side seam. Deeply dented or bulging cans may be a warning sign of botulism, while cans with a sharp dent may damage the seam and allow bacteria to enter the can.

Check Dairy and Milk Products

When buying dairy products, choose cartons and containers that are cold.

Make sure the eggs are clean and aren’t broken or cracked.

Buy milk and other dairy products toward the end of your shopping trip. This will lessen the time these items are out of refrigeration.

Be Selective with Fish and Seafood

Buy fish only from reputable sources such as grocery stores and seafood markets.

Check for proper refrigeration of fresh fish. Look to see that flesh is shiny and firm, not separating from the bone, and the odor is fresh and mild, rather than overly ""fishy"".

Make sure packaged seafood is well-packed in ice and that packages are tightly sealed and free of dents and tears. Avoid packages containing ice crystals. This is a sign the seafood has previously thawed.

Buy unwrapped cooked seafood such as shrimp, crab or smoked fish only if it is displayed in a separate case or a physically separated section from raw fish. Bacteria on raw fish can contaminate cooked fish.

Look Over Meats and Poultry

Make sure packaging is tightly sealed and is very cold to the touch.

Choose packaged chicken that looks pink, not gray.

Always look for the Safe Food Handling label on packages of bacon and fresh sausage. This label means the meat has undergone safe processing and includes handling and cooking tips.

Select meats and poultry after shopping for non-perishable items.

Separate Certain Foods

Put raw meat, poultry and seafood in plastic bags before placing them in your cart. This keeps them from leaking and dripping onto ready-to-eat foods such as bread or produce.

When checking out, place raw meat, poultry and seafood in separate bags from ready-to-eat foods.

At Home

Take groceries home immediately and store them right away. If you must run errands and will be out longer than 30 minutes, bring a cooler with chill packs for perishable foods. The temperature of refrigerated food can go up 8 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit on a typical trip home from the store. Perishable foods must be refrigerated within two hours and only one hour if it is over 90°F outside.

Keep perishable foods out of the hot trunk in summer and place in the air-conditioned car instead.

Promptly refrigerate or freeze perishable items as soon as you get home.",planning

Reviewed:September 06, 2024","Dining out can be a challenging experience for vegans and vegetarians. Some restaurants aren't vegetarian or vegan friendly, while others may not highlight their meatless options. Further complicating the matter is that vegetable dishes might be cooked with animal products, including butter, chicken or meat stock and gelatin. The good news is restaurants are adding or expanding vegan and vegetarian menu options in response to customer requests.

Keeping a few helpful tips in mind can make dining away from home a more enjoyable experience for vegans and vegetarians.

Review Restaurant Menus

For starters, check menus for symbols such as a ""V"" or ""VG,"" or other markers that indicate a dish is vegetarian or vegan. When in doubt, ask the wait staff. Increasingly, servers are being trained to meet the needs of non-meat eaters.

Don't be afraid to make a special request. Some chefs will prepare a dish that is not on the menu, or modify a dish so it fits your preferences. Or, consider ordering vegetable appetizers or a combination of side dishes as your main course. At weddings, work functions or other catered events, request a vegetarian meal in advance or ask the wait staff to swap the meat in your meal for beans or vegetables.

Navigating Fast Food Options

Finding meatless options at fast food restaurants can be challenging, but many restaurants now have salad menus and sandwiches with vegetable or meat substitute fillings. Breakfast items often are vegetarian friendly, especially for those who eat eggs and dairy products.

Dinner Party Advice

Dining at a friend's house? This can be tricky if only one main course is served. If you are invited to someone's house for a meal, let your host know in advance about which foods you do not eat. You also can offer to bring a vegetarian dish to share.

Travel Tips

Airlines, trains and cruise ships are increasingly working to meet the needs of their vegetarian clientele. Before you plan a trip, check with transportation groups to see if they offer vegetarian options. Often you can find vegetarian meals, fruit plates and vegan and lacto-ovo vegetarian menu options. When in doubt, pack vegetarian snacks such as nuts and dried fruit.

Meatless Global Cuisine

Restaurants serving global cuisines often are ideal for vegetarians. Asian menus, such as Chinese, Japanese, Thai and Vietnamese, feature a variety of meatless options including rice and noodle dishes containing vegetables and tofu. However, if you do not eat fish, ask the wait staff whether dishes contain any fish or oyster sauce. South Asian cuisine, including Indian, Sri Lankan, Burmese, Pakistani and Nepali, are known for meatless dishes using breads, lentils, beans, rice, curried vegetables and yogurts. If you do not consume dairy, ensure your dishes are prepared in vegetable oil instead of common ingredients such as ghee (clarified butter), cream and paneer (a type of cheese).

Italian, Greek and Middle Eastern foods offer many meatless options such as pasta primavera, pasta marinara, falafel, couscous, minestrone soup, eggplant dishes, Greek salads and tabbouleh. Olives and feta cheese are high in sodium and should be limited if you're on a low-sodium diet. Mediterranean restaurants sometimes use large amounts of oil for sautéed dishes, dressings and sauces, which add fat and calories to food. Keep this in mind when making your menu selection.

Vegetarian-friendly Mexican cuisine may include burritos, fajitas, tacos, enchiladas, quesadillas and tamales made using rice, beans and cheese. Spanish rice, guacamole and salsa also are vegetarian (be sure rice isn't made using chicken stock). Refried beans may contain lard, so ask the restaurant staff if you are concerned. If you do not eat dairy, order dishes without cheese and sour cream.",planning
All About Chickpeas,https://www.eatright.org/food/food-groups/protein-foods/all-about-chickpeas,"Contributors:Heather A. Goesch, MPH, RDN, LDN and Kerry Neville, MS, RDN
Reviewers:Academy Staff RDNs
Published:February 01, 2021
Reviewed:November 12, 2024","Chickpeas, sometimes referred to by their Spanish name,garbanzos, are a member of the legume family.  The plump, beigeKabulichickpea is the most common type, offering a sweet, nutty, buttery flavor and a creamy texture. In India, the smaller, darker-huedDesivariety prevails — whole beans are calledBengal gram, while golden split beans (with the dark hull removed) are calledchana daloryellow gram.

Nutritionally Speaking

One cup of drained and rinsed canned chickpeas has about 210 calories, 4 grams of fat, 10 grams of dietary fiber and nearly 16% of the daily value for folate. A popular meat alternative, they provide 11 grams of protein and 8% of the daily value for zinc and iron. Phytic acid, or phytate — a compound naturally occurring in legumes — may decrease absorption of iron and zinc (as well as magnesium and calcium), but can be mitigated through soaking, sprouting or boiling.

Chickpeas and other legumes contain bioactive compounds including resistant starch, oligosaccharides and phytosterols. Studies suggest regularly eating legumes may decrease blood pressure, levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and hemoglobin A1c; improve digestive health; and reduce risk of certain cancers.

One significant difference in the nutritional profile between canned and cooked dried chickpeas is the amount of sodium; some cans contain more than 300 milligrams per half cup. Choose cans labeled “low salt/sodium” or “no salt/sodium added” or drain chickpeas and rinse to help decrease sodium content.

Growing

Grown predominantly in India, chickpeas also are cultivated in other countries, including the United States, where they are mainly grown in Washington, Idaho and Montana.

Chickpeas are considered a sustainable, regenerative crop — meaning that growing them can help improve the health of the soil. The plant helps recycle nitrogen and carbon in its environment, is relatively drought tolerant and can help break disease and weed cycles when used as a cover crop.

Availability

Chickpeas are widely available canned or dried. You’ll also find chickpea flour and many chickpea-based foods readily in stores.

Purchasing

While dried beans cost a fraction of the price of canned, most people opt for the ease of canned. Drieddesichickpeas and splitchana dalmay be a little harder to find but are available in Indian markets.

Chickpea flour is usually found in the baking aisle or natural foods section. Hummus, made from chickpeas, is available in a wide variety of flavors. And, due to its popularity as a gluten-free food, you’ll find chickpea pasta, roasted and puffed snacks, tortillas, breads and pizza dough in many stores, too.

Storing

Cans may be stored in the pantry for two to five years from the date of purchase. Keep unopened dried chickpeas in the pantry for up to two years and opened dried chickpeas in a tightly sealed container or bag for up to one year.

Chickpeas from an opened can or prepared from dried should be covered with cooking liquid or water in a sealed container and can be kept in the refrigerator for up to four days. Chickpea flour and meal can be stored in an airtight container in the pantry for up to six months.

Preparing

Canned chickpeas don’t require additional cooking time. Plus, you can remove some of the sodium by draining canned chickpeas and rinsing them well with water.

To prepare dried chickpeas, rinse and discard broken or discolored beans and tiny stones. Soak in cool water for eight to 10 hours to soften beans and improve digestibility. Cook chickpeas using the stove or oven for about one and a half hours; a slow cooker on low for three to six hours; or a pressure cooker for about 20 minutes. One cup of dried chickpeas yields 2½ to 3 cups cooked chickpeas.

Using

Chickpeas can be used in myriad ways. Add to stews and soups as a meat replacement and for texture and nutrition. Puree chickpeas with broth to thicken soups instead of adding cream. Make your own falafel, which features chickpeas as the main ingredient. Use splitchana dalto make Indian dishes like curries, tikkas and dals.

Chickpea flour (also known asbesan) makes the French flatbread,socca,and can be used as a gluten-free option in baking, dredging for frying and thickening.

Roasted chickpeas flavored with spices make an easy, nutritious snack or can be sprinkled on salads and grain dishes. Whip up homemade hummus in a snap by blending chickpeas with tahini, garlic, olive oil and lemon juice in a food processor. Try a “chickpea of the sea” sandwich — the vegetarian version of a tuna sandwich — by mashing chickpeas with olive oil and seasonings and a bit of mayo or avocado for creaminess.

Save the liquid — called aquafaba — from canned or soaked chickpeas. Aquafaba can be whipped into a dairy-free whipped topping or meringue or as an egg substitute for baking. Three tablespoons of aquafaba equals one whole egg.

Just throw all the ingredients in the pot, turn it on, head to work, come home and dinner is ready to be served. But that's not all you can do with a slow cooker. It is perfect for making overnight oatmeal, a dip or even a stew. This is a dream come true for any multitasker, but if you neglect food safety rules, that dream could quickly turn into a nightmare.

Follow these 10 tips to help ensure any dish you slow cook is safe to eat:

Start with a clean space. Make sure the slow cooker, utensils and work area are clean. And don't forget to wash your hands before preparing any food.

Keep perishable foods refrigerated as long as possible.Bacteria multiply rapidly when at room temperature. To avoid this, keep your food refrigerated until it's time to add it to the pot.

Prepare meat and vegetables separately.If you prep your meat and vegetables beforehand, use separate cutting boards and store these foods separately in your fridge to avoid cross-contamination.

Always defrost meat or poultry before putting it in the slow cooker.Defrosting will ensure your food cooks all the way through to its safe internal temperature. Defrost frozen foods in the refrigerator, in the microwave or submerged in cold water — never at room temperature.

Pay attention to temperature.It is important to make sure your slow cooker reaches a bacteria-killing temperature. If you’re able, try starting your slow cooker on the highest setting for the first hour and then switch it to low for longer cooking. However, it is still safe to cook foods on low the entire time — for example, if you are leaving for work. Just make sure your food reaches the proper internal temperature (see tip 9 below).

Make sure foods fit.The slow cooker should be half to two-thirds full to ensure your food cooks thoroughly. Don't overstuff it!

Cut up meats.Large chunks of meat may take too long to cook all the way through. Cut meat into smaller pieces before adding it to a slow cooker.

Keep the lid on.It is important to retain heat when making a slow-cooker meal, so avoid taking off the lid. Only remove the lid to stir or check for doneness.

Use a food thermometer.Theonlyway to know for sure that your food is ready to eat is with a food thermometer.Use a food thermometerto ensure the food has reached the proper internal temperature.

Store leftovers in shallow containers and refrigerate within two hours.One of the best parts of your slow-cooked meal is the leftovers. But make sure you are storing them safely and eating them in a timely manner to reduce your risk of food poisoning.

In a world of advancing technology, it might be hard to believe but not everyone has a dishwasher. Fortunately, it's still possible to effectively and safely wash dishes and other utensils by hand.

If you clean your dishes by hand, take the following steps to ensure your dishes are clean and safe to use.

Scrape or wipe food off dishes before washing.

Wash dishes and utensils in hot, soapy water (at least 110°F).

Rinse well.

Allow dishes to air dry — avoid using a towel to dry dishes, as it can spread bacteria.

Remember to wash cutting boards and any other kitchen surfaces used during food preparation, too. They can be cleaned in a similar way by wiping down the surface to remove food and other materials using clean dishcloths or paper towels and hot, soapy water.

An additional safety measure involves sanitizing the washed surfaces and utensils by using a diluted solution of liquid chlorine bleach and water. Be sure to follow the instructions on the bottle, as this will indicate the amount of water and bleach that are needed and other precautions that should be taken. Allow the bleach solution to stay on the surface for at least one minute before rinsing and allowing to air dry.

Keeping kitchen utensils and surfaces clean reduces the risk of cross-contamination and helps to prevent foodborne illness.",home-food-safety

Remember Balance

Keep in mind, Halloween is just one day a year — it's what kids eat each day that has the most impact on their nutrition and health. Instead of making candy and sweet treats off-limits, serve healthy snacks first, and bring out the sweet treats later when the kids have already filled up on more nutritious foods. One idea is to choose orange foods for the healthy options, such as carrots or baked sweet potato fries. Try adding green guacamole for a dose of heart-healthy unsaturated fat.

For a heartier choice, try black and orange tortilla roll-ups made by layering lean roast beef and low-fat provolone or mozzarella cheese on a sun-dried tomato tortilla. (For a veggie option, use refried black beans instead of roast beef.)

For those special sweet treats that you do allow, provide small portions. Choose fun-size — instead of full-size — candies, miniature cupcakes or muffins, and smaller cookies and brownies (think 2 inches). Serve each child rather than leaving treats out on a table to regulate how many servings each child consumes.

Make Your Own Healthier Treats

Make your own treats that have some nutritional value by including a source of fruits, vegetables nuts or whole grains. Try popcorn tossed with cinnamon and sugar or chocolate-covered fresh fruit as healthier alternatives to candy.  Go for pumpkin treats, such as fiber-packed cinnamon-roasted pumpkin seeds or vitamin A-rich pumpkin chocolate chip mini muffins.

Consider these other healthy, Halloween-themed snack ideas:

Warm apple cider with cinnamon sticks

Smoothiesmade with low-fat vanilla yogurt and canned pumpkin

Apple slices with a fruit dip made with yogurt mixed with canned pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice

Date and pumpkin energy balls

Pumpkin pie dipmade with low-fat cream cheese, Greek yogurt, roasted pumpkin and spices

Baked applesor pears with cinnamon, nuts and honey

Chocolate chip pumpkin barsmade with half whole-wheat flour

Get Everyone Up and Moving



Make sure that the party isn't all about the food. Plan fun activities and games to get the kids moving, such as a costume parade or relay race. Try ""Monster Tag"" — one child is the monster and whomever he or she tags turns into a zombie.

Limit Leftover Candy

When the fun of Halloween is over and kids are left with lots of candy, encourage mindful enjoyment of the treats without restrictive deprivation. Try putting the candy away in a place that is out of sight and you may find that the kids forget about it after a few days. You also can mix leftover candy with whole-grain cereal, nuts and a few pretzels to make a homemade trail mix for snacks.

Make this Halloween an opportunity to teach your child to enjoy special treats,  in moderation, as part of an overall healthy diet.",cultural-cuisines-and-traditions

In fact, families who incorporate frozen foods into their normal routine may have better diet quality. With so many choices in the frozen foods aisle, there are plenty of opportunities to find something you like.

Benefits of Frozen

Fruits and vegetables are picked at peak ripeness and often frozen within hours, locking in nutrients and flavor. Generally, frozen foods retain their vitamins and minerals and there is no change to the carbohydrate, protein or fat content. In some cases, frozen foods have more vitamins and minerals compared to fresh because fresh foods lose vitamins and minerals over time while freezing preserves nutrients.

Frozen foods can be a convenient and affordable way to incorporate healthful foods from every food group, including whole grains, fruits, vegetables, protein and dairy. In addition to a time-saving convenience, frozen foods can be a benefit for individuals with limited kitchen space or utensils. Not only can frozen foods be more affordable in price, but they also can aid in reducing food waste.

Choosing Wisely

Not all frozen foods are created equal — many can be high in saturated fat, added sugars and salt. When selecting frozen foods, look at the Nutrition Facts label and ingredients list and avoid those with added sauces.

When selecting frozen meals or convenience foods, compare Nutrition Facts labels to find nutritious choices. Keep in mind that some frozen dinners are considered more than one serving, which means you will need to double or triple the calories and nutrients listed in the Nutrition Facts if you eat the entire package. Choose those that are lower in saturated fat, added sugars, and salt and higher in fiber, vitamin and mineral content.

Keep it Safe

To keep frozen foods safe, follow cooking methods specified on the package. The safest way to thaw frozen foods is in the refrigerator. When thawing meat in the refrigerator, make sure juices do not drip onto other foods. To thaw in a hurry, place the food in a leak-proof plastic bag and submerge it in cold water until thawed, replacing the cold water every half hour and cooking it immediately after thawing. Foods also can be thawed in the microwave and should be cooked immediately after thawing.",planning
Animal Welfare: The Five Freedoms,https://www.eatright.org/food/planning/food-security-and-sustainability/animal-welfare-the-five-freedoms,"Contributors:Marissa Thiry, MS, RD
Published:March 05, 2024","Many animals in the wild have primal instincts such as hunting or foraging for their own food, finding or building their own shelter and bonding with other animals. When animals interact with humans and are no longer in their natural environment, they may lose some of these primal instincts. Therefore, it’s important that humans provide animals with necessary elements such as food, water and shelter for protection.

Five Freedoms of Animal Welfare

The concept of the Five Freedoms began when the British government appointed a committee to uncover more about the welfare of farm animals. In December 1965, the committee published a technical report known as the Brambell Report, which said that animals should be able to “stand up, lie down, turn around, groom themselves and stretch their limbs.” This concept was later refined by the Farm Animal Welfare Committee (now the Animal Welfare Council) in the United Kingdom to form the Five Freedoms as they are known today.

The Five Freedoms are a guiding set of animal welfare principles that outline key freedoms that all animals, including those raised for food, should experience in their life. Recognized by many people and groups throughout the world, the Five Freedoms are considered the gold standard approach to protect the mental and physical well-being of farm animals by minimizing negative experiences and states, occasionally with slight modifications. According to the United Kingdom’s Animal Welfare Committee (formerly the Farm Animal Welfare Council), the Five Freedoms are:

""Freedom from hunger or thirstby ready access to water and a diet to maintain full health and vigour.

Freedom from discomfort, by providing an appropriate environment.

Freedom from pain, injury or disease, by prevention or rapid diagnosis and treatment.

Freedom to express normal behavior, by providing sufficient space, proper facilities and appropriate company of the animal’s own kind.

Freedom from fear and distress, by ensuring conditions and treatment, which avoid mental suffering.”

How the Five Freedoms Impact Sustainability of Food Systems

Today, principles behind the Five Freedoms are used globally by various people across food systems — including farmers and ranchers — in the development of animal welfare protocols and practices and to shape how animals are raised for food. For example, the Five Freedoms have been referenced in policies and have influenced accreditation programs and legislation with specific requirements, such as clear minimum space standards for farm animals to lie down or standards for veterinary care for sick animals.

Accreditation programs offer a third-party certification to indicate humane animal welfare standards. Many programs in the United States, such as American Humane Certified, Certified Humane®, and the Beef Quality Assurance program, incorporate the Five Freedoms in their certification standards. Most food companies that leverage these certification programs include the certification logo on their packaging, menu or website to inform shoppers of their humane animal welfare practices.

Going Beyond the Five Freedoms

As science and understanding of animals continue to evolve, some experts suggest the Five Freedoms should be replaced with guiding principles that not only prevent negative experiences, but also promote positive experiences, giving all animals a life worth living. The Five Freedoms outline the minimum acceptable standards for animals, and this proposed approach would continue to improve their quality of life. However, it would have implications for food systems including resources, costs, labor and more. Food systems will need to adapt to meet evolving animal welfare needs in the future.",planning
When Should My Kids Snack?,https://www.eatright.org/food/planning/meals-and-snacks/when-should-my-kids-snack,"Contributors:Jo Ellen  Shield, MED RD LD

Reviewed:January 16, 2024","Does it seem like it's always snack time? Many children graze throughout the day, enjoying a never-ending snack time. Snacks are good for kids because they help them stay focused at school and on homework, give them needed nutrients and help keep hunger at bay. Yet, for lots of kids and teens, a snack is a bag of chips, some cookies or some other low-nutrient food. Instead, think of snacks as mini-meals.

Unplanned, random snacking can lead to problems. Nonstop snacking interferes with kids' appetites and can disrupt their natural instinct to experience hunger and fullness. When timed correctly, snacks can help kids get the energy and nutrients they need.

When Should Kids Snack?

Most children and teens need to eat snacks in addition to meals to fuel their growing, active bodies and meet their MyPlate daily recommendations. This translates into the following:

Younger kids need three meals and about two snacks a day.

Older kids need to eat three meals and about one snack a day (they may need two snacks if they're going through a growth spurt or if they are very physically active).

Offer planned meals and snacks consistently throughout the day. A good rule of thumb is to offer snacks a few hours after one meal ends and about one to two hours before the next meal begins. Postponing snacks until a few hours after a meal helps prevent kids from refusing food at a meal and then begging for more food as a ""snack"" just after the meal ends. On the other hand, putting a stop to snacking immediately before meals encourages a healthy appetite at mealtimes.

Where Should Kids Snack?

When at home, designate a certain area as the ""eating-only zone'' and limit all snacking to that location. The kitchen table or countertop works well. When kids snack all over the house, that makes it hard for you to know what and how much they're eating. (Plus, all the crumbs and spills can get messy!) Also, don't let kids eat snacks while watching TV. Studies show that this mindless munching leads to overeating.

Be a Smart Snacker

The following strategies will make you and your family smart snackers:

Expect smaller children to eat smaller portions. Young children may need more frequent snacks than older kids because little ones have smaller stomachs that hold less.

Offer meals and snacks at predictable times.

Be prepared for hungry tummies at predictable snack times. This might mean your kids are extra hungry right after school.

To make sure your kids eat at mealtimes, don't offer snacks too close to a meal.

Offer nutrient-dense foods that are otherwise lacking in the diet and will improve your child's nutrient intake.

Place produce in plain sight. Keep a bowl of fresh, just-ripe whole fruit in the center of your kitchen counter or dining table. Keep small containers of fresh veggie snacks (carrots, celery sticks and broccoli florets) at kids-eye level in the fridge.

Stock your pantry with canned snacks such as fruits canned in juice or natural applesauce made without added sugar. Divide larger cans into smaller portions in reusable containers or buy the convenient single-serve containers.

Cut snacking costs with frozen fruits as they often are less expensive but just as nutritious as the fresh varieties. Purchase frozen strawberries, raspberries and blueberries in large bags; then, use small handfuls for yogurt toppings or as smoothie ingredients.

Offer your kids a snack containing protein and fiber, so the snacks are filling, sustaining and add to the quality of their intake.

How to Marinate Safely,https://www.eatright.org/food/home-food-safety/safe-cooking-and-prep/how-to-marinate-safely,"Contributors:Jackie Newgent, RDN, CDN and Esther Ellis, MS, RDN, LDN

Reviewed:June 23, 2023","Perhaps you're planning to prepare chicken breasts, vegetables skewers or tofu ""steaks"" and you're pondering this culinary dilemma: ""To marinate or not to marinate?"" A burst of extra flavor awaits your taste buds if your response is ""to marinate."" But flavor is not all that may be waiting on your plate.

A marinade may be oil-based or contain an acid such as vinegar, lemon juice or wine and include spices, herbs or other tasty ingredients. Prior to grilling, roasting or sautéing, a food is soaked in this savory sauce to enhance flavor, tenderization or juiciness. Though a marinade can transform food from humdrum to yum, if not utilized with care it can also lead to food safety concerns.

It won't matter how mouthwatering your meat, poultry, fish, veggies or other food is if it becomes a source of food poisoning. Foodborne illness, also known as food poisoning, is the reason why more than 128,000 Americans wind up in the hospital every year. So when you opt for scrumptiousness, always aim for marinating safely by following these five straightforward steps.

Contain it.Marinate food in a food-safe container. Don't use metal as the acid in the marinade can interact with it. If you prefer to marinate in sealable food-safe plastic bags, you'll need to discard them after use, so look for eco-friendly options or use reusable glass containers to minimize waste.

Let the fridge be your friend.Make sure the container of marinating food is fully covered. Place it on the bottom shelf in the refrigerator (at or below 40°F), not on the kitchen counter. This will keep food out of the temperature ""danger zone,"" which is the temperature range where bacteria multiply and may reach unsafe levels.

Pack properly for the park.Consider a picnic cooler as a transportable refrigerator. Make sure your marinating food is in a well-sealed container. Ideally, place it in a cooler designated just for perishable items, pack with ice and keep out of direct sunlight.

Be mindful with the marinade.Cross-contamination can lead to food poisoning. This may occur when a marinade is used on raw meat, poultry or fish, and then reused ""as is"" on cooked food. If reusing marinade on ready to eat food, boil it first before reusing to destroy harmful bacteria. When possible, plan ahead by setting aside some fresh sauce strictly for this purpose before marinating.

Cook for safety; make it tasty.Don't rely solely on your senses. Use afood thermometerto assure marinated meat, poultry or fish is prepared to a safe minimum internal temperature. And regardless of the type of food you're preparing, remember this: When food is cooked to the proper temperature, it won't be undercooked — or overcooked.

Some research suggests that people who eat more canned foods tend to have a higher intake of fruits and vegetables and a higher intake of nutrients compared to people who eat fewer canned fruits and vegetables.

How Canned Foods are Made

Canned fruits and vegetables usually are canned within hours after picking. Some procedures may vary depending on the food item, but once the fruit or vegetable has been picked and transported to the canning facility, it goes through three major steps:

Processing: Fruits and vegetables are washed and often peeled, cut, chopped or pitted before canning. Certain varieties of fruits and vegetables may be blanched beforehand. Dried beans are hydrated and blanched. Once the food is prepared, the cans are filled with either water or juice and seasoned accordingly.

Sealing: After processing, the food is put into cans and the lid is sealed.

Heating: Once the can is sealed, it is quickly heated to a precise temperature for a specified amount of time to kill harmful bacteria and prevent spoilage. After it is heated, it is quickly cooled.

Benefits of Canned Foods

Fruits and vegetables used for canning are picked at peak freshness, ensuring the best flavor and nutrient quality. Canned foods can be just as nutritious as fresh and frozen foods because canning preserves many nutrients. The amount of minerals, fat-soluble vitamins, protein, fat and carbohydrate remain relatively unchanged by the process of canning. But, because the canning process requires high heat, canned goods may have less water-soluble vitamins such as vitamin C and B vitamins. However, the heating process that may harm some vitamins can actually increase the antioxidant content. For instance, canning increases the amount of lycopene in tomatoes.

Canned foods are a convenient and affordable way to incorporate more fruits and vegetables into your diet. The process of canning ensures a long shelf life of at least one to five years. This may be beneficial for people who often throw away fresh produce due to spoilage.

Making Wise Choices

While canned foods can be easy and convenient, there are factors to consider to choose the most nutritious options for you and your family. When purchasing canned fruit, pick varieties that are canned in water, 100% juice or in its own juices. Many varieties of fruit come packed in light or heavy syrup, which translates to added sugars. Choose canned vegetables without added salts, labeled “no salt added” or “low sodium.” Be mindful that cans marked “reduced sodium” are not necessarily sodium-free. Draining and rinsing canned beans and vegetables can help reduce the sodium content as well.

Avoid cans with dents, bulges, cracks or leaks. This may be a sign of the bacteria that causes botulism. Damage to the can may allow air to enter, creating the ideal environment forClostridium botulinumto grow. Botulism is more common in homemade canned goods that are improperly handled and is extremely rare in commercially packaged canned goods.",planning

Here are ideas for getting the most from your fruits and vegetables, no matter what form they take.

Canned Fruits and Vegetables

Get the juice.For canned fruit, look for descriptions on the label like ""packed in its own juices,"" ""packed in 100% juice,"" ""unsweetened"" or ""no added sugar."" Fruits packed in juices contain less added sugar than fruits packed in syrup.

Pinch the salt.If you are cutting back on sodium, look for descriptions such as ""no salt added"" and ""reduced sodium"" on the labels of canned vegetables. Rinsing canned vegetables before eating them can reduce their sodium content.

Savor the flavor.Use canned fruits and vegetables immediately after opening for maximum flavor and nutritional value.

Frozen Varieties

Forgo added fat and sodium.When buying frozen vegetables, skip those with sauces and choose plain vegetables instead. You can season them at home with flavorful herbs and spices.

Check the label.Frozen fruits come in both sweetened and unsweetened varieties, so make sure to check the label and choose unsweetened fruit. Frozen fruit bars also can be a nutritious snack, but read the label to learn if they're made with real fruit juice.

Dried Fruits

Look for additives.Dried fruit may contains dietary fiber, vitamins A and C, potassium and folate, but keep in mind that serving sizes are smaller than other types of fruit. Also, some dried fruits may have added sugar. If you are sensitive to sulfites, check the label of dried fruits to make sure they are not preserved with sulfite, which may trigger an allergic reaction.

Have a handful.Dried fruit is a great portable snack and makes tasty trail mix when combined with nuts and seeds. It also can jazz up salads, pancakes, bread recipes or a bowl of cereal.

There are many varieties of canned, dried and frozen fruits and vegetables on grocery store shelves, which makes it easy to find foods that suit your tastes and fit into a healthy eating plan.

Beans, canned or dried, are an affordable protein source that also provide dietary fiber and other nutrients we need, including folate and potassium. Eating more plant-based foods (even if you’re not a vegetarian or vegan) could benefit your wallet, the environment and your health. TheDietary Guidelines for Americansrecommends adults eat 1 to 3 cups of beans per week, which will depend on calorie needs based on your age, gender and physical activity.

One ½-cup serving of cooked beans has about the same amount of protein (7 grams) as 1 ounce of cooked chicken, beef, pork or fish. Although the protein in beans is not exactly the same as protein from animal sources, when a variety of other plant-based foods are consumed throughout the day — such as grains, vegetables, nuts and seeds — along with enough calories, protein needs can be met. Beans and lentils can be used in many recipes to replace some or even all the meat, depending on the dish.

Canned and dried beans most likely aren't going bad in your pantry any time soon and they're available when you need them. Dried beans stay good for a year as long as they're kept dry, while canned beans are good as long as the can is free of rust, dents or swelling.

While there are many important nutrients packed into each little bean, they are most often noted for being an excellent source of dietary fiber, which is important for digestive health. Dietary fiber may help reduce the risk of heart disease and it promotes a feeling of fullness, which can help with weight management.

Many of us are eating too little dietary fiber, so beans can be a delicious and affordable way to get closer to that goal. A ½-cup serving of cooked beans, provides about 20% of the Daily Value. Other vegetables, fruits and whole grains are sources of dietary fiber, too.

If you don't like beans, luckily there are many creative ways to enjoy them — it's just a matter of finding one that works for your taste buds!

Here are six creative ways to enjoy beans:

Start tiny

While dried beans can take a while to cook, lentils will give you a protein-packed meal in a flash. Lentils are tiny, cook quickly and don't need any soaking time. Just scan for any pebbles in the bag, give lentils a quick rinse with fresh water and cook in boiling water. Red lentils take only five to seven minutes to cook, while green lentils are soft after 15 to 20 minutes. Brown lentils, the most common, cook in 20 to 25 minutes. Use canned lentils for even more time savings.

If the texture of lentils or whole beans is not your favorite, a smooth lentil soup might be more enjoyable. Lentils break down while cooking, but a blender can make them even smoother.

There are lots of bean soup options. Some, such as lentil soup or black bean soup, have beans as the main star while other soups, including the family-favorite minestrone, weave beans in with other featured ingredients.

Slow-Cooker Minestrone

Black Bean Soup with Miso and Ginger

Quick Potato, Vegetable and Bean Stew

Blend them

You may have heard of hummus, a smooth chickpea dip. Although less traditional, these days, you can make or buy hummus in a range of savory or sweet flavors, such as chocolate. Dunk strawberries in chocolate hummus for a sweet treat!

Making hummus doesn’t have to be complicated. Simply combine a drained can of chickpeas (also called garbanzo beans) with a big spoonful of tahini, a tablespoon of lemon juice, one clove of garlic, salt and pepper and a few tablespoons of olive oil in a food processor and blend to your desired consistency. Try making different types of bean dips with other key ingredients, such as black beans or white beans.

In addition to a dip, hummus can be used as a spread on sandwiches, added to wraps or it can serve as a creamy base for homemade pizza, either in addition to or in place of tomato sauce.

Pizza Hummus

Roasted Beet Hummus

Sun-Dried Tomato-Olive Hummus

Mediterranean Pita Pizza

You also may love smooth and creamy beans. Vegetarian refried beans can be purchased in a can or quickly made from canned pinto beans.

Crisp them

Chickpeas are delicious when crisped in the oven. Whether you have a sweet tooth or prefer salty snacks, try rinsing a can of chickpeas, tossing them on a baking sheet with your favorite seasonings, such as pumpkin spice and a drizzle of maple syrup or taco seasoning, and baking them until very crispy. Once cool, crunchy chickpeas can be stored in a jar or portioned into bags for quick on-the-go snacks. Eat these snacks within a week for the most crunch.

Have these baked chickpeas as a snack all by themselves, as a savory crouton or as a crunchy topping for soup.

Curried Garbanzo Bean Poppers

Bake them

Can you believe beans can make delicious desserts? Black bean brownies, white bean blondies and chocolate cookies are all options that can be made with cooked beans! Bean flours, such as chickpea flour, can be purchased at the grocery store.

Take a trip

Beans and lentils are enjoyed around the world. Exploring new recipes and flavors can be a fun way to have a few new menu items in your home.

Try some of the recipes below, or search recipes by cuisine onMyPlate Kitchen.

Pair with pasta

Canned beans can be drained, rinsed and added to your pasta dishes along with other veggies. Beans also can be pureed and mixed into spaghetti sauce for a protein-packed dinner. And, even easier — you can find dried pasta made entirely out of beans.

Quick Penne Pasta with Veggies



What about side effects?

While some gas is completely normal (we have healthy bacteria living in our gut that exhale, just like we do), too much gas can be uncomfortable and embarrassing. Soaking dried beans and discarding the water before cooking them in a pot of fresh, boiling water can help reduce gas.

Ramp up your bean intake slowly and make sure you’re drinking enough water. If you’re dehydrated, increasing your fiber intake can cause constipation and no one wants that!",food-groups
"Know Your Farmer, Know Their Farm",https://www.eatright.org/food/planning/food-security-and-sustainability/know-your-farmer-know-their-farm,"Contributors:Diane Welland, MS, RD
Published:October 10, 2023","Farmers are unsung heroes, working tirelessly to put food on our tables every day. To know your farmer is to appreciate the food they provide — but just as important is to know their farm. The type of farm determines the food produced and is as unique as the people who run it. Here are some popular types of farming operations:

Family Farms

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in 2020, approximately 98% of farms in the United States were considered family farms, meaning relatives were involved with the business. Furthermore, most family farms are small, and many are handed down from generation to generation. In 2021, small family farms accounted for 89% of all U.S. farms. While some small farms produce a single item, such as eggs, others produce several goods, especially when it comes to fruits and vegetables. Many small family farms sell their goods at local farmers markets.

Industrial or Conventional Farms

Industrial farms are large-scale operations that often use synthetic pesticides and fertilizers in order to produce high yields. Often these farms are monocultures, which means they grow the same crop in a large piece of land each year. In livestock production, these farms are called Animal Feeding Operations, or AFOs, if the animals being raised are confined for 45 days or more within a 12-month time frame. Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, or CAFOs, are farms where animals are raised, tended and fed in a confined area; they are defined as small, medium or large, based on the type and number of animals, as well as the waste they produce. The purpose of CAFOs is to reduce the footprint required to raise animals.

Organic Farms

Organic farms grow and process food without synthetic fertilizers or pesticides (organic fertilizers and pesticides are allowed) and follow specific organic farming practices. The USDA has a National Organic Certification program; however, many small farmers — although they may follow organic practices — often choose not get certified, mainly due to cost and paperwork.

Aquaculture/Fish Farms

Aquaculture is the breeding, rearing and harvesting of fish or shellfish and aquatic plants. There are two types: marine and freshwater. Marine farmed fish are usually kept in pens in areas of the ocean, while freshwater fish are in ponds or human-made waterways. Aquaculture was developed to reduce the demand for wild-caught seafood and help rebuild and replenish global seafood supplies. Aquaculture in the U.S. primarily consists of oysters, clams, mussels, salmon, catfish, crawfish, shrimp, trout and tilapia.

Apiaries/Bee Yard

An apiary is the location where beehives are kept, sometimes called a “bee yard.” Beehives can be permanently stationed for pollinating certain crops, or they can be mobile, housed in trucks and moved from place to place. Apiaries can be as small as one or two hives or as large as hundreds of hives such as in commercial operations.

Ranches

A ranch is land specifically used to breed and raise livestock such as cows, horses, sheep and pigs in order to produce meat. Ranches can focus on one single animal such as cattle, or they can include a variety. Ranches also range in size from very small to large swaths of land.

Dairy Farms

Dairy farms are dedicated to raising animals — mainly cows, but also goats, sheep and buffalo — solely for the long-term production of milk. This milk is then processed and sold as is or turned into dairy products including butter and cheese. Although the number of dairy farms has significantly declined over the last few decades, mainly due to consolidation, they still are mostly family-run operations.

Urban Farms

Located in cities, often in unexpected places like rooftops, parking lots, warehouses and other spaces, urban farms can be agricultural or animal based. Many urban farms were developed to supply local businesses such as restaurants, while others rely on community support. All urban farms are uniquely tailored to their environment.

Mixed Farms

Mixed farms grow agricultural products as well as raise and breed livestock.

U-Pick Farms

Farmers at U-pick farms allow customers or the public to pick, choose or cut their own product out of the field or orchard. While some offer a variety of produce, many focus on one or two seasonal items such as apples in the fall, strawberries in the spring and peaches in the summer. They often are located near big cities to attract customers.

Hobby Farms

Hobby farms are small-scale operations (less than 50 acres) run primarily for pleasure rather than a business venture. Owners typically have other jobs off the farm to pay the bills. Unlike homesteaders, hobby farmers are not driven by self-sufficiency.

Cooperative (Co-op) Farms

Co-op farms are a network of farmers who pool their resources together to improve the quality of goods and services. Many small farmers join a co-op to compete with large operations or to offer their goods to a wider audience.

Other Farms

Traditional agriculture grows plants in soil in the ground. Other farms, however, can be vertical, where plants are stacked on top of each other.

There also are hydroponic, aeroponic or aquaponic operations. Hydroponic farms grow plants in a nutrient-rich water solution; aeroponic farms rely on air to supply a nutrient-rich mist to plants; and aquaponic farms combine aquaculture with hydroponic systems, raising fish to produce waste which then feeds the plants. The plants then purify the water for the fish, creating a mutually beneficial relationship. All these methods seek to produce high yields with minimal resources and less land use, making them well-suited for urban settings.

Over the years, farm practices have evolved and grown dramatically to adapt to new technology and the changing environment. Knowing your farmer and the farm they own goes a long way in understanding where your food comes from and how it gets from farm to table.",planning

There are two simple methods to check the accuracy of a food thermometer — one uses ice and the other uses boiling water. This is because freezing and boiling points are almost always the same, with the exception of certain altitudes.

Ice Water Method

Materials needed: a large glass, crushed ice and clean water

After filling a large glass with finely crushed ice, pour clean tap water on top of the ice and stir well. Dip the food thermometer stem 2 inches into the glass of ice water without touching the bottom or the sides of the glass. Wait 30 seconds to allow the thermometer to adjust. It should read 32°F.

Boiling Water Method

Materials needed: a deep pot and water

In a deep pot, bring distilled water to a rolling boil. Dip the thermometer stem 2 inches into the boiling water without touching the bottom or sides of the pot. Wait 30 seconds and the thermometer should read 212°F.

How to Calibrate Thermometers

The process of adjusting your thermometer for accuracy is known as calibration. Different types of thermometers may need to be calibrated in different ways so make sure to check the manufacturer's instructions.

For dial or non-digital thermometers:If the temperature does not read 32°F using the ice water method or 212°F for the boiling water method, adjust the temperature by turning the calibration nut just under the head of the thermometer until the pointer reads the correct temperature or follow the manufacturer's instructions. Keep the thermometer in the water as you adjust, as the temperature will change once you remove it.

For digital thermometers: Follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Some thermometers cannot be calibrated.

Note:In high-altitude areas, water boils at a lower temperature, so check with your local Cooperative Extension Service or Health Department for the exact temperature of boiling water in your area.",home-food-safety

To keep your perishable foods fresh, make sure your refrigerator is set at or below 40°F. This will help keep foods out of what's called the “temperature danger zone."" This zone is the temperature range where bacteria multiply quickest, between 40°F and 140°F. Keep a refrigerator thermometer inside your refrigerator in the front where it can be easily read to help make sure you’re in the right zone.

Make sure groceries, ingredients when preparing food and leftovers don’t sit out at room temperature for longer than two hours. In hot weather (90°F or above), this time is reduced to one hour. The longer food sits out at these temperatures, the more time bacteria has to multiply.

This may mean stocking up on fresh water, shelf-stable foods, batteries, flashlights, phone charger packs and other supplies, but it also means keeping health documentation, current medications and other necessities handy in the event of an evacuation.

After a disaster, people need to assess all food and food preparation areas and equipment to decide what to keep or throw away. Power outages may be among the most common results of a natural event, whether it be a hurricane, flood, earthquake, winter storm, wildfire or other disaster. Other events, especially if accompanied by flooding, can contaminate the public water supply, making water in the affected area unsafe to drink. Local announcements should provide updated information on the water supply.

Power Outages

If the power in a refrigerator goes out, keep the refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible to maintain the cold temperature. The refrigerator will keep food cold for about four hours if it is unopened. A full freezer will keep the temperature for approximately 48 hours (24 hours if it is half full) if the door remains closed. Buy dry or block ice to keep the refrigerator as cold as possible if the power is going to be out for a prolonged period of time.

Once the power is restored, determine the safety of your food. If an appliance thermometer was kept in the freezer, check the temperature when the power comes back on. If the freezer thermometer reads 40°F or below, the food is safe and may be refrozen. If a thermometer has not been kept in the freezer, check each package of food to determine its safety. You can't rely on appearance or odor. If the food still contains ice crystals or is 40°F or below, it is safe to refreeze or cook.

Refrigerated food should be safe as long as the power was out for no more than four hours and the fridge door was kept closed. Discard any perishable food (such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs or leftovers) that has been above 40°F for two hours or more.

Perishable food such as meat, poultry, seafood, milk and eggs that are not kept adequately refrigerated or frozen may cause illness if consumed, even when they are thoroughly cooked.

Flood Waters

Do not eat any food that may have come into contact with flood water.If in doubt, throw it out.

Do not eat food packed in plastic, paper, cardboard, cloth and similar containers that have been water damaged.

Discard food and beverage containers with screw-caps, snap lids, crimped caps (soda bottles), twist caps, flip tops and home canned foods, if they have come in contact with flood water. These containers cannot be disinfected.

Undamaged, commercially prepared foods in all-metal cans or retort pouches can be saved if you remove the labels, thoroughly wash the cans, rinse them and then disinfect them with a sanitizing solution consisting of 1 tablespoon of bleach per gallon of potable water. Finally, use a marker to re-label containers that had the labels removed, including the expiration date.

Discard refrigerators that have been submerged in flood water, or if enough moisture was present from liquefied food items to reach the insulation inside the equipment.

Run your empty dishwasher to flush the water lines and ensure they are cleaned internally before washing dishes and utensils in it.

Discard all ice in ice machines; clean and sanitize (1 tablespoon of bleach per gallon of potable water) the interior surfaces; run the ice through three cycles and discard ice with each cycle.

Drinking Water

Area health departments will determine whether tap water can be used for drinking. If water is not potable or is questionable, follow these directions to purify it:

Usebottled waterthat has not been exposed to flood waters, if it is available.

If you don't have bottled water, you shouldboil waterto make it safe. Boiling water will kill most types of disease-causing organisms that may be present. If water is cloudy, filter it through clean cloths or allow it to settle, and draw off clear water for boiling. Boil the water and let it cool, and store it in clean containers with covers.

If you can't boil water, you candisinfect it using household bleach. Bleach will kill some, but not all, types of disease-causing organisms that may be in the water.Add ⅛ teaspoon (or eight drops)of regular, unscented, liquid household bleachfor each gallon of water, stir it well and let it stand for 30 minutes before you use it. Store disinfected water in clean containers with covers.

If you have a well that has been flooded, the water should be tested and disinfected after flood waters recede. If you suspect that your well may be contaminated, contact your local or state health department or agriculture extension agent for specific advice.

Food Contact Surfaces and Equipment

When cleaning or disinfecting, wear protective clothing, such as gloves, to avoid skin contact, irritation or infection.

Discard wooden cutting boards, wooden dishes and utensils, plastic utensils, baby bottle nipples and pacifiers that have come into contact with flood water. These items cannot be safely cleaned.

Thoroughly wash metal pans, ceramic dishes and utensils (including can openers) with soap and water, using hot water if available. Rinse and then sanitize by boiling in clean water or immersing them for 15 minutes in a solution of 1 tablespoon of unscented, liquid chlorine bleach per gallon of drinking water (or the cleanest, clearest water available).

Thoroughly wash countertops with soap and water, using hot water if available. Rinse and then sanitize by applying a solution of 1 tablespoon of unscented, liquid chlorine bleach per gallon of drinking water (or the cleanest, clearest water available). Allow to air dry.

Make sure to carefully clean corners, cracks and crevices, door handles and door seals in rooms that have been affected by flood water.

Kids might be less active in the cold, winter months, making it extra important to focus on getting the right nutrition this time of year. Changes in mood, energy, focus, appetite and sleep aren’t uncommon but could be signs of a more serious underlying condition. If you’re concerned about your child’s emotional and mental health, have a conversation with your child and their pediatrician. Healthful food choices also can help support your child’s mental health. Consider including the following foods to help your kids stay healthy — and happy — this winter.

Salmon

Amino acids such as tryptophan, tyrosine and glutamine are a few of the building blocks of protein found in salmon and other protein foods. These amino acids produce neurotransmitters that contribute to mood regulation. Emerging research links nutrients in fish with lower risk of depression. Salmon is packed with omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown in some studies to help manage depression. While we need more research to confirm mental health benefits, we already know that fish is an excellent heart-healthy source of protein. Some kids will eat salmon broiled or grilled — try using a marinade or sauce they love on other foods — or cut the fish into small pieces and make kebabs with veggies.

Clementines

Clementines are an adorable winter citrus, packed with vitamin C, which helps keep immune systems strong. They also provide dietary fiber. Kids love that they're usually seedless, easy to peel and fun to eat, making them perfect for school lunchboxes or snacks. You also can toss the sections into salads to make greens more appealing.

Winter Squash

Butternut squash is rich in vitamin A and carotenoids, which have been shown to benefit heart health and immunity. It’s also a good source of dietary fiber, which helps keep blood sugar levels stable. Most winter squash varieties are naturally sweet, and what kid doesn't like sweet? Try roasting butternut or acorn squash and tossing with cinnamon and maple syrup. Spaghetti squash is another popular winter squash. Try baking it and adding your child's favorite pasta sauce on top.

Sweet Potatoes

Packed with vitamin A and potassium, another great source of dietary fiber is sweet potatoes.  Their mellow, sweet taste works in all kinds of recipes. Slice into thin ""coins"" and toss with canola or olive oil before roasting. Sweet potato puree can be used in foods including macaroni and cheese, oatmeal and brownies. Try swapping in baked sweet potatoes as an alternative to French fries. Have your kids help with peeling so they're involved in the cooking process.

Cauliflower

This member of the cruciferous veggie family has been noted for its high phytochemical content. Cauliflower is delicious on its own but easily blends with other flavors. It's rich in vitamin C and a good source of vitamin K for a healthy immune system and healthy bones. And that's not all! Cauliflower also is a good source of folate, a B-vitamin important for growth and development, while dietary fiber promotes stable energy levels and digestion. Cauliflower is delicious roasted, but if your kid is averse to eating veggies, try making cauliflower ""rice"" in a food processor and adding it to a stir-fry.",food-preparation

The 2020-2025Dietary Guidelines for Americansadvise limiting your intake of saturated fat to less than 10% of your daily calories.Here’s a summary of some of the evidence behind a few of the more common health claims associated with coconut oil.

Helping with Weight Loss

Some weight loss programs tout coconut oil because it contains medium chain triglycerides, or MCTs. Advocates for MCTs claim it promotes weight loss, increases metabolism and reduces belly bloat. However, the research is limited. These claims are based on a few studies done with a small number of participants. Plus, both the amount of weight and inches lost by study participants were very small. In some of the studies, participants made other changes that could have promoted those changes. For example, they ate fewer calories and exercised more. So, at this time, more research is needed.

Controlling Type 2 Diabetes

Diabetes causes the level of glucose, or sugar, in your blood to rise above the normal level. Animal studies suggest that coconut oil may be beneficial for managing blood sugar. However, findings in animal studies may not be the same for humans. And, there currently is limited evidence supporting the value of coconut oil for people with Type 2 diabetes. If you have Type 2 diabetes, treat coconut oil like any other saturated fat and limit your intake by choosing foods that are higher in unsaturated fat.

Reversing Alzheimer's Disease

The link between brain health and coconut oil stems from the MCTs. Glucose, which your body gets from the foods you eat, is the main source of energy for the brain. Some researchers believe that the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease do not efficiently break down glucose for energy. Therefore, their brains need an alternative source of energy. One theory is that the MCTs found in coconut oil may be able to provide that backup energy source. While this sounds encouraging, at this point, research is minimal.

What the Research Shows

What is known is that coconut oil is high in saturated fat. And, diets high in saturated fat may raise cholesterol levels in the body, which could increase your risk for heart attack and stroke.

Research shows that replacing saturated fats, such as coconut oil, withpolyunsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats, such as olive oil, is beneficial for overall health.",food-groups

If you are hosting or attending a gathering this holiday season and want to lighten up your offerings without sacrificing taste, you have plenty of options.

Try swapping out a few ingredients in your favorite recipeswith some of these simple tips.

Try low-sodium vegetable broth in your mashed potatoes to add flavor and cut back on butter or margarine.

Substitute applesauce for oil, margarine or butter in muffins and quick breads such as banana bread. Try substituting a small amount at first, as too much may change the texture of the finished product.

For dips and sauces, try using fat-free yogurt in place of sour cream or mayonnaise.

Try sliced or slivered almonds as a delicious, crunchy topping in place of fried onions.

Choose reduced-fat or fat-free cheeses for salads and casseroles.

Pack your shopping cart with plenty of fresh produceincluding sweet potatoes, winter squash, broccoli, carrots and green beans. Apples, fresh cranberries and pears combine easily for a tasty salad, fruit crisp or topping for the turkey.

If you are a guest at a dinner party or other gathering,consider these tips to keep your night healthy, happy and safe:

Try starting your day with a small meal that includes whole grains, fruit, vegetables and some type of lean protein. Skipping meals before the event may lead some people to overeat later.

Socialize and settle into the festivities before seeking out the buffet.

Savor foods you truly enjoy and pass on those that don't really interest you.

Move your socializing away from the buffet tables or appetizer trays. This will minimize the unconscious nibbling.

When it comes to alcohol, satisfy your thirst by drinking water first. If you are of legal age and choose to drink, moderate alcohol consumption is defined as up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks for men.

Keep in mind, even a single drink may affect your reflexes for several hours. If you plan to drink, keep your holidays merry for everyone by designating a driver who won't be drinking.

The holidays are a great time for gathering with friends and family over food and drinks. With just a little preparation, you can enjoy celebratory foods mindfully and still experience all that the season has to offer.",cultural-cuisines-and-traditions

Reviewed:March 31, 2025","Food insecurity is when there is a lack of consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life. Malnutrition can be an unintended consequence of food insecurity and it can attribute to many health conditions and chronic diseases.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 13.5% of American households were food insecure in 2023. And nearly 8.9% of households with children were food insecure. That's around 3.2 million households. Children who lack access to healthful food may have difficulty learning, as well as mood and behavioral problems. Adults who lack access to healthful food may experience mental health issues and chronic diseases such as diabetes.

In addition, a report from the U.S. Secretary of Defense found that approximately 25.3% of all active duty personnel would be classified by the USDA as having low food security in 2020. Among these, 10.5% would be classified as having very low food security.

Social determinants of health play a role in food insecurity. The conditions in which a person lives impact how easy it is to get healthful foods. For instance, poverty and unemployment can lead to food insecurity. Additionally, racial disparities exist. According to the USDA, in 2023, Black households and Hispanic households experienced rates of food insecurity higher than other demographics. In 2023, all households lead by a single parent also experienced food insecurity at a significantly higher rate.

As a result of these driving forces, individuals may choose less expensive, calorie-dense foods that don’t deliver all the nutrients they need. This may lead to unintended weight gain or chronic health conditions from the lack of nutrients their bodies need.

Resources for People Facing Food Insecurity

If you or someone you know is food insecure in the United States, there are a number of resources that can help:

FoodPantries:Local food pantries are often community run and organized resources that provide groceries and meals to individuals who need them. Feeding America is a national network that can connect individuals to their local food bank and provides a variety of additional resources, like SNAP application assistance, as well.

School Breakfast Program: Schools offer low-cost or free breakfasts for eligible children.

National School Lunch Program: Schools also offer low-cost or free lunches for eligible children.

Meals on Wheels:This program is focused primarily on individuals with decreased mobility and who are 60 years of age and older. Participants are eligible for free or low-cost meals which may be served at senior centers or delivered to their homes.

Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC): WIC is designed to serve pregnant, postpartum and breastfeeding women at nutrition risk, in addition to infants and children up until the age of five who are at nutritional risk. Program participants are eligible to receive supplemental foods and nutrition education.

Summer Food Service Program: Provides free lunches for school-age children and teens in low-income areas during summer months when school is not in session.

Reviewed:September 26, 2023","MyPlateprovides an easy tool for helping you to include servings from each of the five food groups. One easy step to follow is to divide a plate into four sections when you eat, and add a serving of low-fat or fat-free dairy or a fortified soy alternative with each meal:

Grains: Fill one-quarter of your plate with grains — and aim to make at least half of them each day be a whole grain, such as brown rice, whole-wheat pasta or whole-grain bread.

Protein Foods: Make one-quarter of your plate a protein food, such as an egg, fish, chicken or a lean source of meat. Vegetarian sources of protein count, too — beans, lentils and tofu, for example.

Fruits: Fill another quarter of your plate with fruit such as blueberries, tangerine slices or strawberries.

Vegetables: The last quarter is for vegetables such as spinach, broccoli or carrots.

Dairy: Include a serving of fat-free or low-fat dairy, such as milk, yogurt or cheese, with every meal. Lactose-free dairy and fortified soy versions of milk and yogurt also are options.

MyPlate makes healthy eating easier and, with a little creative thinking, you can apply this way of eating when you’ve got an urge for fast food. Just keep in mind that some menu options can be high in salt and include extra calories from saturated fat and added sugars. However, when you decide to eat out, MyPlate offers a guide for selecting healthier options from the five food groups and helps you be mindful of portion sizes to stay within your calorie needs.

Breakfast

To eat within the MyPlate recommendations, focus on whole fruits more often instead of 100% fruit juice to get the added benefit of dietary fiber. Watch out for sources of added sugars. For example, instead of adding white or brown sugar to oatmeal, add fruit for a touch of sweetness.

Here are some tips on how to incorporate the five food groups into some common breakfast menu items.

Oatmeal: Oatmeal is available at many places and is a great way to get whole grains. Remember, MyPlate recommends at least half of the grains you eat during the day come from whole-grain sources.

Grains: Oats are a whole grain that provide dietary fiber.

Protein: Adding unsalted nuts or seeds can boost protein.

Fruit: If the oatmeal doesn’t come with fruit, ask if you can order some fresh fruit or unsweetened applesauce for a side. Some fast food restaurants offer fruit options with kid’s meals.

Vegetables: Make a mental note to eat more veggies at lunch and dinner.

Dairy: If your oatmeal isn’t made with milk, ask for low-fat or fat-free milk to drink on the side.

Breakfast burrito: A carefully ordered burrito can provide options from all five food groups! Select a small burrito packed with delicious ingredients.

Grains: Opt for a whole-wheat tortilla, if available, for your grain serving.

Protein: Eggs and beans are both good sources of protein.

Fruit: Order apple slices or another fruit option on the side.

Vegetables: Ask that bell peppers, tomatoes, onion or other vegetables be added to your burrito.

Dairy: Including cheese in the burrito provides a source of dairy.

Lunch and Dinner

To embrace healthier options at the drive thru, try including a small green salad with light dressing. Most restaurants serve sandwich options on white buns. For a more healthful option, choose whole-grain buns where available. And ask for mustard instead of mayonnaise, which can save a significant amount of calories and saturated fat.



Chicken:Chicken is a versatile protein that is featured on many menus when dining out.

Protein: Select a grilled chicken sandwich or a small order of chicken nuggets. Consider grilled chicken nuggets where available.

Grains: The top and bottom of the bun each count as an ounce-equivalent of grains (or more) depending on their size.

Fruits: Add an order of apple slices or a fruit cup on the side.

Vegetables: Order a small side salad and with dressing on the side, if possible.

Dairy: For a beverage, choose fat-free or low-fat milk. If dairy is not an option, opt for water instead of drinks with added sugars.

Burger and Fries:A hamburger with fries is an American classic. The good news is, it can fit within a healthy eating style:

Protein: The meat patty is a source of protein. Go for a single cheeseburger, rather than a double.

Grain: Opt for a whole-grain bun when available.

Fruits: Add an order of apple slices, unsweetened applesauce or a fruit cup.

Vegetables: Add tomatoes, onions and lettuce to your burger. If you’re ordering fries, get a kids’ size or split a small order with someone else.

Dairy: Adding cheese to your burger will incorporate dairy in your meal.

Check the Website

To help make the healthiest choices, before you eat out, check the restaurant’s website or look for calorie information posted on the menu. Review the nutrition information to help you figure out what you might order ahead of time.

Making small changes to what you order when eating out can help you build your healthy eating routine, as MyPlate recommends.",planning
"Reduce Plate Waste: School, Home and Eating Out",https://www.eatright.org/food/planning/food-security-and-sustainability/reduce-plate-waste-school-home-and-eating-out,"Contributors:Sarah Klemm, RDN, CD, LDN

Reviewed:March 16, 2023","According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service, more than one hundred billion pounds of food go to waste each year. As food systems evolve to reduce this, so do discussions about what we can do toreduce food wasteat schools, in retail locations such as restaurants and supermarkets, and at home.

There are many reasons for wasted food at the table, sometimes known as ""plate waste."" If kids don't like the taste of a food, they won't eat it. Food also is thrown away if lunch is served when students aren't hungry, if lunch periods are too short or if students rush through their meals to start recess. Peer pressure may discourage some kids from trying new foods or admitting that they like foods their friends may not enjoy. Some schools measure plate waste and use this information to adjust their menus, recipes and the lunchroom environment, improving their ability to provide tasty and nutritious meals to their students.

Parents: Get Involved

Reducing plate waste at school may help lower the school district's meal costs and boost your child's nutrition.

Take a look at your school's menus.Many schools post menus online or distribute them in parent newsletters. Review food options and discuss them with your child, asking which items your child likes.

Encourage your child to try new foods, as well as familiar foods in new ways.Maybe your child has never tasted mango or sweet potato, or perhaps your child doesn't enjoy raw broccoli. Describe the taste and texture of new foods to reduce possible anxiety. Discuss the crunch of raw broccoli after dipping it into low-fat ranch dressing, for example.

Find out what they ate.After school, ask your children what they ate, what they liked and what they didn't like. Ask if they had enough time to eat. When appropriate, share this feedback with your school's nutrition team or principal.

Make trying new foods a family activity.Exposing your children to new foods at home will help them accept unfamiliar foods elsewhere.

Reduce Plate Waste at Home

Reducing plate waste at home is a good way to save money and boost kids' nutrition as well. Try serving meals family-style — allowing your children to select foods they want in appropriate portions. If there are leftovers, store them safely in the refrigerator or freezer to enjoy later.

Teach your children that good nutrition can help them grow and do well in school and sports. Kids will copy their parents, so show them that you enjoy good nutrition and new foods.

Dining Out

Some of the same questions that pertain to your child's school lunchroom experience can be applied to eating away from the home. Offering kids the opportunity to try foods while dining out is a great time to try dishes you don't usually make at home.

Using the same strategies registered dietitian nutritionists suggest for portion control, such as splitting meals or having the server box up half the meal before it's served, can help reduce food waste as well.",planning
What to Look for in Cottage Cheese,https://www.eatright.org/food/food-groups/dairy-and-alternatives/what-to-look-for-in-cottage-cheese,"Contributors:Serena Ball, MS, RDN
Published:July 11, 2023","Packed with protein, cottage cheese is a soft, fresh cheese. The tangy flavor of the fresh curds can be enjoyed as is, with added savory or sweet toppings or even as an ingredient in other dishes.

Cottage cheese is made by adding an acid, such as vinegar or a probiotic culture, to milk in order to separate the curds (solid) from the whey (liquid). The curds are then cut into large or small pieces and cooked to release moisture. Rinsing and draining then removes even more liquid and decreases the acidity. Cottage cheese curds are generally salted. Often cream or thickeners are added for a creamy texture.

Types of Cottage Cheese

Percentage of fat. Fat-free, 1% and 2% fat cottage cheese have less saturated fat and fewer calories than the 4% fat variety, which includes cream. Lower fat varieties also generally have slightly more protein.

Large curd or small curd. Large curd cottage cheese tends to be higher in moisture than small curd cottage cheese, so it may be perceived as tasting creamier and sweeter than the latter, but this is not necessarily true. Small curd does, however, tend to taste slightly tangier and more acidic.

Whipped. This smooth-textured cottage cheese is spreadable.

Dry curd or farmer cheese. Cottage cheese curds are allowed to drain longer so they become dry, firm and form a dense cottage cheese also known as farmer cheese.

Probiotic. To obtain these beneficial bacteria, cottage cheese products that contain probiotics must have the container labeled as having “live and active cultures.”

Lactose-free. This type of cottage cheese is free of lactose, which is found in the whey of milk and other dairy products. Much of the whey is drained out of cottage cheese, making it naturally lower in lactose than milk. Some people with lactose intolerance can eat cottage cheese with few symptoms.

Flavored. Cottage cheese is sold plain or flavored. Check the label for added sugars, which are often present with fruit-flavored varieties.

I bought cottage cheese. Now what?

Sprinkle it. Make a savory cottage cheese bowl by topping a serving with savory spices such as cumin and black pepper, along with nuts or a drizzle of tahini.

Spread it. For breakfast or lunch, spread it on whole-grain toast and top with brightly colored fruit such as berries or slices of kiwi or avocado.

Mix it. Instead of using mayonnaise, make egg salad or tuna salad with cottage cheese. Serve on a big bed of greens.

Scoop it. For a protein boost, scoop cottage cheese onto a bowl of cooked rice, pasta or oatmeal; swirl it into eggs before scrambling; or top pancakes with cottage cheese and fresh fruit or fruit canned in 100% juice.

Dip it. Use cottage cheese as an ingredient for a creamy dip likethis recipewith customizable flavors. Prevent food waste by adding leftovers from the fridge: make a sweet dip sweet by blending in ripe fruit and a drizzle of honey. Or, go savory with whatever herbs you have on hand or green onions. Serve with whole-grain crackers or flatbread.

Use as a paneer substitute. Paneer is a style of cottage cheese originating in India. Cottage cheese may be used as a substitute for paneer in dishes such as curry, masala and more.

Blend it. Once blended, cottage cheese has the consistency of yogurt or sour cream, but with a less tangy taste. Use it in chocolate pudding, vanilla ice cream and blueberry smoothies.

Cook or bake with it. For recipes such as lasagna or stuffed shells, cottage cheese is often listed as a substitute for ricotta cheese. Some breads and muffins also may include cottage cheese as a protein-rich ingredient.

Cottage Cheese Nutrition Information

One-half cup is the serving size often listed on the Nutrition Facts panel, but snack-sized cups of cottage cheese are usually 5 to 6 ounces.

Because cottage cheese is lower in calcium compared to other dairy products, including milk and yogurt, 2 cups of cottage cheese counts as a 1-cup serving in the dairy food group of MyPlate. Cottage cheese is considered high in sodium, but there are lower sodium versions available.

A ½-cup serving of 2% fat cottage cheese (not low-sodium) contains approximately:

85 calories

4 grams carbohydrates (as the natural milk sugar lactose, and 0 grams added sugars)

11 grams protein

2.5 grams total fat

1.3 grams saturated fat

18% daily value (DV) sodium

2% DV potassium

8% DV calcium

Other essential vitamins and minerals including phosphorus, magnesium and vitamin B12; unlike milk, cottage cheese is not generally fortified with vitamins A and D.

A ½-cup serving of cottage cheese has about double the amount of sodium of a (1-ounce) serving of hard cheese, such as cheddar. However, cottage cheese typically has 1.5 times theproteinof hard cheeses, less saturated fat and five times morepotassium. Additionally, eating cottage cheese with potassium-rich fruits and vegetables may help offset or limit theeffect of sodium on blood pressure.",food-groups
Can Rare Meat Be Safe,https://www.eatright.org/food/home-food-safety/safe-cooking-and-prep/can-rare-meat-be-safe,"Contributors:Jackie Newgent, RDN, CDN
Published:September 04, 2020
Reviewed:August 10, 2020","Do you enjoy meat that is cooked until it is just rare or medium-rare? It's OK if you're not a fan of well-done meat. You don't need to give up enjoying foods prepared the way you like. But you should know the safest way to savor lightly cooked meat.

What's the Temperature?

Afood thermometeris the most important tool in your food safety toolbox. And using it is the only way to ensure meat is prepared to a safe minimum internal temperature when harmful food bacteria, such asSalmonellaandE. coli, will be destroyed. When not destroyed, these bacteria can lead to serious illness or possibly death. An instant-read food thermometer is inexpensive and only takes a few seconds to use. It's priceless if it prevents food poisoning.

Try the ""Goldilocks"" Approach

Is well-done the way to go? You don't need to aim for well-done meat to make it safe to eat — unless, of course, you prefer it that way. The better approach is simply checking the temperature of your meat to assure you're not undercooking or overcooking it. Ultimately, a food thermometer helps guarantee you're cooking meat until the ""just-right"" doneness for juiciness and deliciousness.

Caution: Your Senses May Be Misleading

Your senses play an important role in deciding what foods to eat. However, don't rely exclusively on your senses to determine if your meat is cooked safely. Color and texture are not reliable indicators of properly prepared meat. Research confirms that. Specifically, a brown color, firm texture or clear juices should not be counted on to determine doneness or confirm safety. Likewise, a pink color doesn't necessarily mean that a meat is undercooked. A food thermometer will provide the final answer on proper doneness.

The Rules About Rare

Is rare or medium-rare meat ever safe to eat? If beef, veal, pork or lamb are ground, the answer is no. That's mainly because the process of grinding can introduce potentially harmful bacteria on the meat surface into the ground meat. Ground meat needs to reach 160°F internally — at least a doneness of medium. (Dishes prepared with ground turkey or chicken need to reach an internal temperature of 165°F.)

If the fresh meat is a steak, roast or chop, then yes — medium-rare can be safe. That means the meat needs to reach 145°F internally and stand for three or more minutes before cutting or consuming. Unfortunately, even if preferred by foodies, there's no way to guarantee the safety of rare meat. That also means raw meat delights, such as steak tartare or beef carpaccio, are not considered safe, especially for people who are at higher risk of food poisoning.  Pregnant women, children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems should avoid all raw and undercooked meats.

The Bottom Line

Food taste and food safety can go hand in hand. Use a food thermometer to assure meat is prepared thoroughly. And then you can enjoy… thoroughly.",home-food-safety

Reviewed:September 13, 2023","Enjoying food with family and friends is one of the highlights of the holiday season! While it's great that everyone wants to help, too many cooks in the kitchen can result in an increased risk of food poisoning, which can cause severe and even life-threatening illness. Easy-to-follow, safe food handling practices help protect everyone in the family from getting sick.

Here are some food safety tips to help avoid common kitchen blunders when preparing meals, buffets and even homemade food gifts this holiday season.

Share the Gift of Home Food Safety This Season

Follow these simple steps to properly handle food and reduce the risk of food poisoning:

Defrost carefully.Never allow foods to thaw at room temperature, on the counter or in warm water. Defrost food only in the refrigerator, microwave or in a cool water bath (inside a leak-proof plastic bag) with water that is changed every 30 minutes. When defrosting food in the refrigerator, remember to cover raw meat and place it on the bottom shelf so juices won't drip onto other foods. When thawing food in the microwave, cook it immediately afterward.

Wash hands before, during and after food preparation.Proper hand-washing may eliminate a large percentage of food poisoning cases. Remember to wash hands when switching tasks, such as handling raw meat and then cutting vegetables. Wash hands with soap in clean, running water for at least 20 seconds.

Keep kitchen surfaces clean.Use hot, soapy water to wash countertops and surfaces, cutting boards, refrigerator door handles and utensils. After tidying up, keep it clean by avoiding cross-contamination.

Use two cutting boards.Dedicate one for raw meat, poultry and fish and the other for ready-to-eat foods, such as fruits and vegetables. Make it easy to remember by using color-coded cutting boards, one for raw meats and one for ready-to-eat foods.

Employ different utensils for different tasks.Use separate spoons and forks to taste, stir and serve food.

Resist temptation.When baking, avoid eating foods containing raw eggs or uncooked flour, such as cookie dough or cake batter. These ingredients may contain bacteria that can lead to food poisoning if not cooked first.

Buy and use a food thermometer.It is the only reliable way to determine the doneness of your food and ensure that food is cooked to proper internal temperatures. (Do not rely on ""clear juices"" to tell that the turkey is done.)

Refrigerate food within two hours of serving.This helps to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria that can lead to food poisoning and is especially important when serving buffets. Use a refrigerator thermometer and make sure it's set at below 40°F.

Know how to handle mold.Discovering your ingredients have gone bad can be disappointing, but don’t put your family or guests at risk by serving food that may make them ill. A few foods, such as firm fruits and vegetables and hard cheese, can still be used if you remove about one inch around the moldy spot. Soft fruits, vegetables, cheeses, casseroles and any foods with a high moisture content, such as bread, jam or yogurt, should be discarded if it begins to mold.

Practice kitchen safety.Ensure your kitchen is ready with the tools and resources you need before the big event.

Are Your Guests at High Risk for Food Poisoning?

While you should always practice safe food handling, some guests might be particularly vulnerable to food poisoning, including older adults, pregnant women, young children and people with weakened immune systems. This may mean taking special precautions and keeping certainhigh-risk foodsoff the menu.

Whether you're bringing a holiday dish to the party or preparing the holiday feast yourself, it's important to practice safe food handling and keep in mind the needs of those who may be vulnerable to food poisoning.

Take special care during the holidays to ensure vulnerable guests avoid high-risk foods, such as raw or under-cooked eggs, raw or unpasteurized dairy products, raw fish or shellfish, raw or rare meat and under-cooked poultry.

Joy to the Leftovers

Holiday meals often bring leftovers. Perishable food should not be left at room temperature for more than two hours. Refrigerate or freeze leftovers within two hours of serving or throw them out. In hot weather, when 90°F or above, refrigerate or toss food within one hour of serving. Use an appliance thermometer to check that the refrigerator is cooling to 40°F or below and the freezer is 0°F or below.

Store leftovers in shallow containers. Remove turkey from the bone and store it separately from the stuffing and gravy. Slice breast meat into smaller portions to speed up cooling; legs and wings may be left whole. Use turkey, stuffing and gravy within 3 to 4 days. Reheat leftovers to 165°F.

When in doubt, throw it out!",cultural-cuisines-and-traditions

Food poisoning (also known as foodborne illness or foodborne disease) is an illness caused by bacteria or other pathogens in food. Food poisoning causes an estimated 48 million illnesses (1 out of 6 Americans) with 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths each year in the United States, according to  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Who Is at Risk for Food Poisoning?

Everyone has some risk of getting food poisoning, but some people are at greater risk of developing serious illness with long-term effects. These high-risk groups include older adults, infants and young children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems and chronic illness such as diabetes, kidney disease, HIV/AIDS and some cancer patients.

Causes of Food Poisoning

The top five pathogens accounting for the vast majority of food poisoning outbreaks include: Norovirus,Salmonella, Clostridium perfringens, CampylobacterandStaphylococcus aureus.Food poisoning also can result from foods or drinks that are contaminated withEscherichia coli(E.Coli),ListeriaandClostridium botulinum(or botulism) and result in severe reactions requiring hospitalization.

Food Poisoning Symptoms

The symptoms and severity of food poisoning vary, but common symptoms include upset stomach, abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, fever and dehydration.

Long-Term Risks and Side Effects

Although long-term risks of food poisoning are relatively rare, they can be very serious when they do happen, resulting in problems such as kidney failure, chronic arthritis and brain or nerve damage. In extreme cases, foodborne illness can result in death.

How to Reduce the Risk of Food Poisoning

You can significantly reduce your risk of food poisoning by handling food properly and following four easy steps:

Wash.Wash your hands, all surfaces and utensils used to prepare food and all fresh fruits and vegetables.

Separate.Keep raw meat, poultry, seafood and eggs separate from ready-to-eat foods.

Cook.Use a food thermometer to make sure foods are cooked to the appropriate internal temperature.

Refrigerate.Store perishable foods at or below 40°F within two hours. If the surrounding temperature is above 90°F, then refrigerate within one hour.",home-food-safety

Reviewed:February 28, 2020","When it comes to food safety, there are a few key factors you have control over in reducing your risk of foodborne illness, also known as food poisoning. One of these factors is temperature control.

Whether you're storing foods for later or serving them immediately, you must keep your foods at a safe temperature and out of the ""danger zone.""

What is the Danger Zone?

As the name suggests, the danger zone refers to a temperature range at which it is dangerous for foods to be held. That range is between 40°F and 140°F.

Why So Dangerous?

Bacteria grow rapidly between 40°F and 140°F and, under the right circumstances, they can double in amount nearly every 20 minutes. Many foods offer the perfect environment for bacteria to grow.

Who’s at Risk?

Harmful bacteria are one of the main sources of food poisoning in the United States. Many people with a foodborne illness will experience mild symptoms and get better without treatment, but individuals with severe symptoms should seek medical attention.

Anyone can get a foodborne illness but some individuals are at a higher risk — pregnant women, young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are at a greater risk for food poisoning even when small amounts of bacteria are present in food.

How to Reduce Your Risk of Food Poisoning

In order to reduce your risk of food poisoning, make sure to keep your foods out of the danger zone. Refrigerate all foods at or below 40°F within two hours of being out, or within one hour if the outdoor temperature is 90°F or warmer.

Before eating leftovers, reheat them to a minimum internal temperature of 165°F.",home-food-safety

Reviewed:January 30, 2023","If you are one of the many households in the United States that grow their own produce or shop in bulk at farmstands, then you may enjoy canning fresh fruits and vegetables, too!

Part of the ""farm your own food"" philosophy is about preserving what you grow to help feed your household throughout the year. Food that is properly canned and kept in a cool, dry environment will last for at least one year. Home canning is affordable and trendy, but can be deadly if proper safety precautions are not taken during the canning process.

From 1996 to 2014, 30% of foodborne botulism outbreaks reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from home-prepared foods were from home-canned vegetables. Botulism is a rare but serious illness caused by a germ calledClostridium botulinum, found in soil. The germ can multiply and produce toxins in improperly canned food. Here are some helpful guidelines to help prevent this devastating germ from ruining your food.

Home Canning the Safe Way

Follow USDA-approved modern canning methods.You might be using the same recipes passed down through generations of family members but make sure your canning methods are up-to-date. Canning methods and equipment have improved food safety over time. Follow current guidelines from theU.S. Department of Agriculture's Complete Guide to Home Canningor your state's County Extension Service.

Use a pressure canner.The acidity of foods adds extra protection when preserving them. Most fruits contain enough acid that they can be preserved by hot water canning — a method of boiling the prepared, sealed jar in water. Other foods, such as vegetables and meats, have a much lower acidity, which puts them at risk for botulism. For low-acid foods, pressure canning is the only method to kill the germ that causes botulism. It helps the contents of the jar reach a higher temperature than boiling alone. This higher temperature is essential for destroying botulism spores.

Add acidity to tomatoes.The natural acidity of tomatoes can vary. While some varieties are acidic, others are actually considered a low-acid food. Be sure to add lemon juice or citric acid to the mixture to help keep it safe, especially if you’re using hot water canning.

Pick the Right Pressure Canner

Select a pressure canner big enough to hold at least four-quart jars; the USDA does not recommend pressure canners smaller than this size.

Use canners with the Underwriter's Laboratory, or UL, approval to confirm their safety.

Safeguard your canning process by making sure the canner is in good working condition.

Check all openings for cleanliness.

Examine the rubber gasket provided with some brands of pressure canners. The gasket should be flexible and soft, not brittle, sticky or cracked.

Understand altitude adjustments during processing; printed procedures should be with the manufacturer's instructions.

Step-by-step procedures for proper use of pressure canners are described in the National Center for Food Preservation's fact sheet,Using Pressure Canners.",home-food-safety

If you can't remember the last time you gave your fridge a good wipe down — or it's so stuffed that you can't find a thing in it — it could be time for an overhaul.

Out with the Old

Except for infant formulas, product dates are not expiration dates. The terms ""sell by,"" ""best by"" and ""use by,"" may give you a reference for how long a food might last, but they’re generally an indicator of when a product should be used for best quality. The dates of food packages let you know when foods are freshest and taste their best.However, when in doubt, throw it out!



A Cleaner, Healthier and More Organized Fridge

When scrubbing the kitchen, include a ""refrigerator make-over"" on your to-do list. Not only will the fridge be spotless, it will improve the safety and quality of your foods. For the best cleaning results, always refer to your owner's manual.

Step 1: Keep It Safe

Set the temperature in your refrigerator below 40°F. This keeps food cold enough to prevent bacterial growth, which can cause food poisoning. If your refrigerator doesn't have a built-in thermometer, an appliance thermometer placed on the center shelf also will work.

Step 2: Keep It Clean

Use soap and water: Once a week, give your fridge a good cleaning. Wipe down all shelves and compartments with hot, soapy water. Then rinse well and dry thoroughly. Check all bottles and jars for drips and rinse and dry those as well.

Wipe it up: Spills can spread bacteria fast. Between cleanings, wipe up any leaks or spills with hot, soapy water.

Get organized: Make food easy to find by storing leftovers in clear glass containers. Placing smaller items in the front and taller items in the back also can help.

Freshen it: Keep an open box of baking soda in your fridge so it will always smell clean and fresh. Change the box every three months at the time of your next make-over.

Step 3: Keep It Fresh.

Making sure foods are at their peak of freshness not only protects your family from food poisoning, it also helps your food taste better.

Schedule a weekly check: While most leftover food is generally safe for about three to four days, freshness can vary from food to food. The FoodKeeper app can tell you exactly how long you can safely store everything from soup to steak.

Wrap it right: Make sure all meat, poultry and seafood are either tightly wrapped or stored in sealed containers. This will ensure that their juices don't leak and contaminate other foods.

Step 4: Assign Foods Prime Real Estate.

To keep foods at maximum freshness:

Condiments: Store on the door — condiments have a long shelf-life and are okay in this warm part of your refrigerator.

Orange juice: Stow on interior shelf to keep the juice cold.

Butter: Keep butter in its original wrapper or a covered dish and put inside your fridge. FYI: The butter keeper in your fridge door is not cold enough to keep it fresh.

Milk: Store milk where it's coldest, specifically the back of the bottom shelf.

Yogurt: Cover the yogurt with a tight lid and store it in the interior of your fridge up to 10 days past the ""sell by"" date.

Eggs: Keep eggs in their original cartons in the center of the fridge.

Deli meat: Stash deli meats and cheeses in the meat drawer, where it gets an additional blast of cold air.

Packaged raw meat: Store packaged raw meat on the bottom shelf and make sure and dripping doesn’t contaminate other foods. Defrosting meats on the bottom shelf in a covered container reduces the chance of a spill and cross-contamination.

Produce: Store fruits and vegetables in the crisper drawer. If yours has dual controls, adjust them to allow for higher humidity for vegetables and lower humidity for fruits.",home-food-safety
Cooking Guide for High Altitudes,https://www.eatright.org/food/home-food-safety/safe-cooking-and-prep/cooking-guide-for-high-altitudes,"Contributors:Taylor Wolfram, MS, RDN, LDN
Published:July 12, 2017
Reviewed:June 23, 2017","Good food out of thin air is as easy as it sounds if you keep in mind two key factors when cooking at a high altitude: time and temperature. As elevation increases, the atmospheric pressure decreases, or becomes thinner. The atmosphere becomes drier and liquids evaporate more rapidly, resulting in the need for changes in cooking methods. High altitude is defined as an elevation of 3,000 feet or more above sea level. Even at elevations of 2,000 feet, the temperature of boiling water changes from the standard 212°F at sea level to 208°F.

Boiling or simmering foods at high altitude means lower temperatures and longer cooking times. Ensure your food is cooked long enough yet stays moist and full of flavor with these four tips.

Add a Quarter

Moist heating methods for meat and poultry, such as boiling, simmering or braising, will take up to 25% more cooking time. For example, if you are simmering a roast at 325°F that would usually take two hours to cook at sea level, that same roast cooked at high altitudes at 325°F would require 2½ hours of cook time. Increasing cook time does not apply to oven-roasted meat or poultry; oven temperatures remain unaffected in high altitudes. Use sea-level cooking instructions for oven baking.

Increase Cook Time, Not Heat

Hiking up the temperature while boiling foods will not cook food faster. The liquid will simply boil away more quickly and food will dry out. The temperature of a boiling liquid cannot exceed its own boiling point, except when using a pressure cooker. Instead, increase the cook time.

Cover Your Food

Retain moisture in meat and poultry products or any boiled food by tightly covering the pan during cooking. To continue to keep foods moist, cover dishes after cooking.

Use a Food Thermometer

To avoid undercooking or overcooking meat, poultry and leftovers, especially in a high altitude environment, use a food thermometer to confirm internal temperature.

High altitude influences all forms of cooking from using a fryer, pressure cooker or wok to microwaving foods. Consult the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service's guidelines forsafe cooking at high altitudesfor specific instructions for various methods of cooking.",home-food-safety

Here are a few tips when bringing a piece of the farm back to your table.

Plan ahead.Bring a list of what foods you need. Scoping out the market's website or event guide gives an idea of what is offered. If you’re bringing kids along, get them excited about what new foods will be there, and ask your child what new things they would like to try.

Try something new.Challenge yourself and your child to try at least one new food item. The farmers market is the perfect setting for sampling unique foods. Many food stands will offer samples to passersby interested in trying their foods.

Talk to the farmers.Take this opportunity to meet your local farmers and producers in a relaxed setting. Use this time to have a conversation with the people responsible for growing or making your food. Farmers enjoy getting to know you and appreciate your interest in their crops.

Ask questions.Not sure how to incorporate that purple potato into a dish your family would like? Ask the individuals selling the foods. They are a wealth of knowledge and are likely to have various ideas on how to use their food as ingredients in your recipes. Some even have recipes available for you to take home.

Follow the MyPlate method.Most farmers markets offer a wide variety of foods; most are delicious and nutritious, but some are high in calories. When choosing foods, remember theUSDA's MyPlatemethod which emphasizes making half your plate fruits and vegetables, and filling the rest of your plate with whole grains and lean protein.

Make a farm-to-table meal.Now, use a medley of what you gathered at the farmers market to prepare your meal. Involve your child in the kitchen, helping to prepare the various ingredients. Try this Heirloom Tomato-Basil Salad recipe after going to your local farmers market:

Plan ahead — you want half of both yours and your child’s plate to be veggies and fruits, one quarter protein and one quarter grains.

Prepare a vegetable plate in minutes with grilled squash, mushrooms, peppers, corn, carrots or cauliflower. Toss the veggies with a splash of olive oil and your favorite seasoning and place them on the grill. Do this first and set them out for everyone to munch on while the other food is prepared.

Trade traditional mayo-heavy coleslaw for a fresh carrot salad dressed with plain Greek yogurt, raisins and chopped apples. This sweet and crunchy dish is a kid favorite!

Combine a cooked whole-wheat pasta such as bowtie, penne, or orzo or grain such as couscous, quinoa, millet or sorghum with Chinese broccoli, beans and colorful peppers to create a pasta salad.

Choose lean ground beef, turkey or chicken for your burgers. Kids also enjoyveggie burgers made of chickpeasor black beans.

Make sliders instead of full-size burgers. Use whole-grain dinner rolls for the buns. Serve them with romaine lettuce leaves and tomato slices.

Grill marinated shrimp or chicken skewers. Add peppers or grape tomatoes for sweetness, dietary fiber and a dose of vegetables.

Grill pineapple rings or peach halves until their natural sugars caramelize. Present the grilled fruit on a dessert bar with low-fat or fat-free vanilla yogurt or soy yogurt, nuts as sprinkles and fresh cherry toppers.

Exposing your kids to healthy eating and cooking early in life is key. There are lots of ways to make food prep a family affair.

Wash:Ask kids to rinse and dry a large bunch of grapes or berries for a fruit salad.

Stir:Let children mix pre-measured herbs, spices and lemon juice to create a flavorful yogurt dip or sauce for vegetables.

Chop: Supervise older children as they chop vegetables and fruit, thread chunks of fruits and vegetables onto skewers for grilling, and put together more involved dishes by following recipes.

Assemble:Lay out pre-chopped ingredients to create grill-ready foil packets of potatoes, peppers, onions and seasonings. Have kids go down the line, assembling each packet.

Engaging kids in food prep and cooking gives them a sense of accomplishment and ownership of what they eat. Lending a hand in the kitchen is fun and encourages children to taste the fruits of their labor.

Sure, you can do your part by buying lots of healthy foods but your teen can get involved too, by helping to prepare some of those foods. Why? When teens learn healthy cooking skills at home, they'll be better prepared to plan balanced meals and make their own food choices after they leave home.

To help your teen get cooking, stock your kitchen with these easy-to-prepare staples.

Popcorn

Who doesn't crave crunchy snacks? Invest in a popcorn popper! Popcorn is a whole grain, plus it's loaded with dietary fiber for a healthy digestive system. Three air-popped cups deliver nearly four grams of dietary fiber.

Canned Beans

When it comes to making a quick meal, it doesn't get much easier than cannedbeans— just rinse, drain and heat! They're perfect for burritos, mashed on a tortilla, or added to canned soup for extra protein.

Nut Butters

Even if teens have no clue how to cook, that doesn't mean they can't whip up a simple meal or snack. Nut and seed butters — such as peanut, almond or sunflower butter — all are perfect no-fuss foods for the novice cook. They're a cinch to spread on toast with sliced bananas or make a tasty dip for apples, celery or bell pepper strips.

Eggs

Whether fried, scrambled or hard-boiled, eggs are an easy protein food for teen cooks. With a prep and cook time of less than five minutes, eggs are an easy addition to any meal. They are a great source of protein, vitamin B12, choline and phosphorus – all essential nutrients for teens.

Prepped Vegetables

It doesn't matter whether they're fresh, frozen or canned, the more pre-prepped vegetables you have on hand, the more likely your teen will eat them. Think pre-cut baby carrots and hummus for snacks, frozen edamame and peas to add to pasta and diced tomatoes for chili.

Grains

Busy teens don't have a lot of time to spend in the kitchen, but that doesn't mean dinner has to be a sandwich. Quick-cooking whole grains such as quinoa, instant brown rice and whole-wheat couscous take less than 15 minutes from start to finish. For a speedy meal, teens can toss cooked whole grains with microwaved frozen vegetables, season them with lower-sodium soy sauce, and add a convenient source of protein, such as cooked frozen or canned chicken or seafood, canned beans or tofu.

Lean Protein

When you teach teens basic cooking techniques you'll be amazed by how quickly they catch on. Start by showing them how to grill, bake or broil marinated chicken, fish or beef. Or, demonstrate how to sauté ground chicken or turkey, tempeh or tofu to add to spaghetti sauce, chili or tacos.

Before you know it, your teen will be tellingyouwhat's for dinner.

All About Cauliflower,https://www.eatright.org/food/food-groups/vegetables/all-about-cauliflower,"Contributors:Mindy Hermann, MBA, RD and Kerry Neville, MS, RDN
Reviewers:Academy Staff RDNs
Published:January 17, 2013
Reviewed:October 15, 2024","Cauliflower is a member of the same group of cruciferous vegetables as cabbage, Brussels sprouts and broccoli. While the origin of this group of vegetables dates back more than 2,000 years, cauliflower became popular in Europe during the 1500s. In more recent times, cauliflower has experienced a resurgence as one of the most popular vegetables consumed, thanks to its generally tasteless flavor, versatility as an ingredient in prepared foods and gluten-free nature.

Nutritionally Speaking

A longstanding representative for white vegetables, one cup of chopped raw cauliflower is a good source of folate and an excellent source of vitamin C. Cultivation of mutant cauliflower strains has broadened cauliflower’s color palette, as well as its nutrition profile. Carotenoids are responsible for the orange color and increased beta-carotene content in orange cauliflower. Broccoflower (green cauliflower) gets its vibrant hue from chloroplasts, and anthocyanins give purple cauliflower its vibrant color.

Like other cruciferous vegetables, cauliflower is a source of phytochemicals and antioxidants.  Glucosinolates contribute to cauliflower’s distinct aroma and flavor. Some research shows that cruciferous vegetables, like cauliflower, may even help reduce risk of certain cancers.

Growing

Cauliflower is a staple at farmers markets around the country, but most commercial domestic cauliflower is cultivated in California, where it enjoys a nearly year-long growing season.

Availability

Cauliflower is available fresh or frozen, year-round. You’ll also find cauliflower in lots of different prepared food products, such as frozen cauliflower “rice,” pizza crusts and more.

Purchasing

For the freshest cauliflower, choose heads with crisp, tight leaves, and avoid bruised or dry heads. Bags of washed, ready-to-eat florets are convenient. Look for brightly colored florets without blemishes, brown spots, speckles or mushiness.

Storing

Fresh cauliflower can be temperamental — delicious if handled and cooked properly, but unpleasant when stored incorrectly. Cauliflower needs to be stored in a cold, dry environment, and it tolerates only a short stay in the refrigerator. Keep fresh cauliflower away from ethylene-producing fruits such as apples and pears — they cause discoloration.

Refrigerate unopened bags of ready-to-eat cauliflower florets for up to two weeks or until the “use by” date; finish open bags within three to five days. Leftover cooked cauliflower should be refrigerated and eaten within three to five days.

Preparing

Clean the whole head of cauliflower prior to using it by rinsing under clean water, then patting dry.

Break the head into small florets to use raw, steam or roast. Cauliflower steaks are popular as a vegetarian alternative to cuts of meat. To make steaks, trim the very bottom of the core, making sure to keep the head of cauliflower intact. Slice lengthwise, into even ¾-inch thick slices — you can probably get about three steaks per head of cauliflower. The outer slices will likely fall apart, but these can be roasted as florets along with the steaks. Place steaks in a single layer on baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with your choice of seasoning and roast in the oven, carefully turning them over midway through cooking, and re-season. Steaks are done when they are browned and fork tender.

Another popular way to prepare cauliflower is by making cauliflower ""rice.""  Use a box grater or food processor to grate large pieces of cauliflower into rice-size pieces. Sauté in a little oil, then cover with a lid so the cauliflower steams and becomes more tender. Add seasonings as desired and use as a substitute for regular rice in recipes.

Using

Raw cauliflower florets can be tossed into salads or used on veggie trays with dip. Steaming or microwaving preserves nutrients while brightening the color and mellowing the flavor. Cauliflower cooked with the lid on or cooled while covered can develop off-flavors and aromas. To bring out the sweetness in cauliflower, drizzle fresh florets with olive oil and roast in the oven until lightly browned. Some chefs recommend covering the pan with foil for the first 10 minutes to allow the florets to steam. Cooked and pureed cauliflower works well in soups, casseroles and mashed potatoes, and is often undetected, since its taste is relatively flavorless.

Italian cuisine often pairs cauliflower with pasta or features it solo as a side dish baked with a breadcrumb topping. It is a standard in Indian cuisine alongside potatoes (gobi aloo); onion, tomato and coconut (gobi korma); or spicy sauce (gobi masala).

Before You Go, Pack Foods with Care

Clean your produce.Rinse all fresh produce under running tap water before packing it in a cooler, including produce with peel-away skins or rinds.

Keep cold food cold.Place cold food in coolers with frozen gel packs or ice. Stashing it at 40°F or below prevents bacterial growth. Consider packing beverages in one cooler and perishable foods in another since you are likely to grab beverages most often, opening the cooler more frequently. Sliced fruit and veggies, hummus, guacamole and yogurt are good snacks to store in the other cooler.

Keep hot food hot.That means your best bet when packing is to take a pass on hot food unless you have a portable heating unit that can be used safely.

Pack healthy non-perishable snacks.No matter if you’re traveling by land, air or sea, your family can eat healthfully with these simple options:Whole or dried fruit.Nuts (pre-portioned into snack-size bags).Nut butters (travel packs are great for planes).Whole-grain pretzels, crackers and bread sticks.Trail mix.Snack bars. Look for bars made with whole grains, nuts and fruit and with minimal amounts of added sugars.

Nut butters (travel packs are great for planes).

Whole-grain pretzels, crackers and bread sticks.

Trail mix.

Snack bars. Look for bars made with whole grains, nuts and fruit and with minimal amounts of added sugars.

Carry hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes.These come in handy for washing your hands or other surfaces when you’re on the go and don’t have easy access to running water.

Once You're Off, Keep Food Safety in Mind

Clean your hands before you eat.Even if you don't need to use the restroom, you'll still want to wash away germs you picked up in the airport or train station. Wash with soap and water or hand sanitizer.

Be safe with water.Water is regulated and tested throughout the U.S., but, when in doubt, don't drink the tap or well water. This also goes for anything made with water, such as ice or fountain drinks. Stick with sealed, bottled beverages if you have any concerns about the local water supply.

Remember the two-hour rule.If you buy cold or hot food at the airport or train station, eat it within two hours of purchasing. After that, bacteria multiply. (In hot weather, the safe time limit is one hour.) Set a timer on your watch or phone to remind you.

Think before eating.On the plane, clean off your tray table with disinfectant wipes. Never set food directly on the tray table. If hot food is served on the plane or train, make sure it is, indeed, hot.

Eat Right While Traveling

Choose healthy snacks.These choices are easy to carry and are available in many gas station marts and airport terminals:Part-skim mozzarella cheese stick.Whole-grain sandwich with lean meat, vegetables and mustard.Salad with lean protein.Vegetable soup.Fat-free latte.Fruit cup.Pre-cut veggies.

Part-skim mozzarella cheese stick.

Whole-grain sandwich with lean meat, vegetables and mustard.

Fruit cup.

Pre-cut veggies.

Markets.Pick up pre-washed/pre-cut vegetables, hummus, yogurt, sandwiches, salads and fruit with peels including oranges and bananas.

Sandwich shops.Choose whole-grain bread, extra vegetables and mustard instead of oil or mayo.

Drive-thrus and casual restaurants.Focus on items that are grilled, steamed, broiled or baked instead of fried or sautéed. Consider salads with lean protein and a vinaigrette-based dressing, broth-based soups, oatmeal and eggs with whole-grain bread. If you're craving comfort food, just watch your portions — stick to the basics such as a single burger patty without special sauces, kid-size sides and water instead of soda.

At Your Destination, Seek Out Healthy Bites

At a hotel, ask for a room with a mini-fridge.Then visit the local market for grocery staples. That way you can keep healthful items on hand for snacks or breakfast.

Be cautious about continental breakfasts.It’s not uncommon for hotel breakfast bars to be stocked with cereals with large amounts of added sugar, pastries and other suboptimal choices. If your hotel offers this complimentary meal, go ahead and scope it out, but look for whole-grain cereals with fat-free or low-fat milk, fruit or yogurt.

Beware of buffets.Before you grab a plate, walk around the buffet and decide which foods you'll choose. Steer clear of any food that's served at room temperature — that's within the temperature ""danger zone"" where bacteria can thrive. Aim to make half your plate fruits and vegetables, one-quarter lean protein and one-quarter whole grains.",planning

Food banks receive surplus foods from national sources, as well as local donations from charities, church groups and individuals. These items then make their way to food pantries. Some distribute prepared boxes with a variety of foods. Others allow you to walk through and fill a box yourself. Food pantries are a good source for staples such as rice, pasta and canned goods.

Visit Your Local Farmers Market

If your neighborhood doesn't have a supermarket, check out other options for buying fresh produce. For example, farmers markets are sprouting up in many underserved neighborhoods. These markets provide fresh, locally grown produce that you often can purchase with SNAP dollars. And there's another perk: Some states will give additional dollars for SNAP participants who use farmers markets.

Or, plant a simple garden. Even if you live in an apartment, there are certain herbs and vegetables you can sprout at home. Plant your family's favorite veggies in a clean clay or plastic pot, bucket or another container and place it on a porch, balcony, windowsill or sunny spot.

Food Sharing

Many families and friends use informal food sharing to stretch their budgets. For gardeners and farmers, it may mean exchanging crops. Or, suburbanites might split the cost of foods bought in bulk at discount grocery stores. Another option is to exchange cooked meals once or twice a week, which also saves you meal prep time!

Check Out WIC — If Kids Are Age 5 or Younger

WIC is the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children. This program provides services for low-income, pregnant, breastfeeding and postpartum women. WIC also serves infants and children up to age 5 who are at risk for poor nutrition.

If you're eligible, you'll receive:

Foods to help meet the nutrition needs of yourself and your young children. For example, iron-fortified cereal, whole-wheat bread, eggs, milk, cheese, beans, peanut butter, canned fish, fruits and vegetables and vitamin C-rich fruit juice.

Foods for young children such as baby food, iron-fortified infant cereals and iron-fortified infant formulas.

Referrals to health care providers.

Education about nutrition and breastfeeding.

Give Your Kids a Head Start

Head Start is a program for preschoolers. Eligible 3- and 4-year-old children attend Head Start to help get them ready for school. Typically, kids can eat breakfast and lunch at this preschool program which also helps stretch the family’s food budget.

Take Advantage of School Meals

Depending on your family's income level, your child may qualify for free or reduced cost meals at school. Overall, school meal programs may provide breakfast, lunch and snacks. Specific offerings for school meals vary by district. School meals are healthier than ever — many districts now serve lean meat, low-fat dairy, whole grains and fruits and vegetables. For children with parents who work shifts during the evening meal, after-school meal programs may be available, providing many children with a nutritious dinner. And, when school isn’t in session, the Summer Food Service Program provides nutritious meals to fill the void.

Choose Healthy Fats,https://www.eatright.org/food/food-groups/fats/choose-healthy-fats,"Contributors:Barbara Gordon, RDN, LD

Reviewed:June 18, 2024","It used to be that all types of dietary fat got a bad rap. Now, there are countless news stories touting the benefits of fat. So, what’s true? Different types of fat play a different role in your health. Some types of fat have been shown to have health benefits, whereas others are related to health risks. A good standard to go by is to replace foods higher in saturated fat with foods higher in unsaturated fats to promote health.

A nutritious eating plan doesn't mean cutting out all fat — just focusing on healthier varieties. Not sure how to get started? Begin by making small changes. A general goal is for 20% to 35% of your total daily calories to come from healthy fats, such as polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, and fewer than 10% of calories per day from saturated fats.

The Omegas

Omega-3 fats are a type of polyunsaturated fatty acid that may offer health benefits, such as:

Promoting normal functions of the brain and nervous system

Lowering cholesterol levels and supporting heart health

Protecting against dry eye disease

Reducing inflammation in the body

There are three main types of omega-3 fatty acids we get from food. Their scientific names, which can be tongue twisters, relate to their chemical structures. So, they are often referred to by three-letter acronyms:

ALA, or alpha-linolenic acid

DHA, or docosahexaenoic acid

EPA, or eicosapentaenoic acid

The body cannot make omega-3 fatty acids, so you must get them through the foods you eat. Some foods and beverages may be fortified with omega-3s, for example, eggs, milk and soy drinks. The body can convert the ALA you get from food into DHA and EPA. However, the amount made is limited, so including a variety of foods in your day is important. Some people may benefit from a supplement, but be sure to discuss it first with a health care provider.

What to Eat

Fatty fish:Include fish high in omega-3 fats at least twice per week. For example, salmon, herring, sardines, lake trout and Atlantic or Pacific mackerel.

Walnuts:Walnuts are a plant-based source of omega-3 fatty acids. Add walnuts to cereal, salads or muffins. Try walnut oil in salad dressings and sauces.

Flaxseed:Your body cannot break down whole flaxseeds to access the omega-3-containing oil, so to get the health benefits, select ground flaxseed. Add it to breakfast cereal, yogurt, baked goods including breads and muffins, or mixed dishes and casseroles. You also can drizzle flaxseed oil over quinoa or use it for salad dressing.

Chia seeds: These small seeds are packed with nutrients. In addition to omega-3s, they contain protein, dietary fiber, vitamins and minerals. Toss them into your cereal, salads and even baked goods.

Hemp seeds: These seeds also are packed with omega-3s and protein. They can be eaten raw, cooked or toasted.

Eggs:Some chickens are given feed that is high in omega-3s so their eggs will contain more as well. When buying eggs, check the package label.

Monounsaturated Fats

These healthy fats help to increase HDL, the “good” cholesterol in the body. Eating monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fats, such as vegetable oils, in place of saturated fats, such as butter and lard, may help reduce cholesterol in the body. Cholesterol is a waxy substance that can build up and clog blood vessels. The narrowed or blocked blood vessels increase your risk for heart attack or stroke.

What to Eat

Nuts:In addition to heart-healthy fats, nuts are a good source of protein, dietary fiber and a variety of vitamins and minerals. Just keep portion control in mind and choose unsalted ones. A portion of nuts is 1 ounce and provides approximately 160 to 180 calories. Enjoy a small handful of nuts instead of chips or other fried snacks.

Oils:Use oils such as olive and canola in place of solid fats (e.g., butter). Use oil in salad dressing or to sauté vegetables, seafood, poultry, meat, tofu and tempeh.

Avocado:Avocados not only contain monounsaturated fat, but also are packed with dietary fiber, potassium and vitamins (folate and vitamins B6, C and E). Try adding avocado to salad, pizza, soup, salsa, eggs and sandwiches. Enjoy avocado spread on toast for breakfast.

Peanut butter:Nearly half the fat in peanut butter is monounsaturated fat. Resist the urge to pour off the heart-healthy oil that's separated out of natural peanut butter — mix it in!

Recipes Featuring Healthy Fats

The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics’ website has an assortment of healthy recipes, including options for breakfast, lunch and dinner. There are lots of snack options and even treats for your sweet tooth, too.

Examples of nutrients provided by these foods, which are part of the MyPlate Dairy Group, include calcium, potassium, vitamins A and D, as well as protein. But dairy isn’t the only source of these key nutrients!Soymilk and soy-based yogurt also provide protein and can be a source of calcium, vitamin A and vitamin D when fortified  with these nutrients. They are considered to be the closest nutritionally to cow’s milk and dairy yogurt compared to other plant-based alternatives and are part of the dairy food group for this reason.According to the 2020-2025Dietary Guidelines for Americans, ""Other products sold as 'milks' but made from plants (e.g., almond, rice, coconut, oat and hemp 'milks') may contain calcium and be consumed as a source of calcium, but they are not included as part of the dairy group because their overall nutritional content is not similar to dairy milk and fortified soy beverages.""It’s important to note that only breastmilk or infant formula are recommended for children younger than 12 months old, so other types of milk including cow’s milk and soy-based beverages should not be served to children until age 1. Dairy foods like cheese as well as soy-based yogurt are acceptable choices  when infants are developmentally ready for solid foods, which usually occurs around 4 to 6 months of age.

When Dairy is Not an Option

Children may not consume dairy for a variety of reasons including food allergies, lactose intolerance, cultural or family preferences such as a vegan eating style. Whatever your family’s dietary preferences or health concerns are, there are ways to provide nutrition for growing bodies, but it requires some additional guidance and planning.

When at the store, keep in mind that not all types and brands of plant-based milk alternatives are created equal. Parents should compare Nutrition Facts labels and select beverages that provide nutrients including calcium, protein and vitamin D and no added sugars.

Multiple food allergies can make choosing a milk alternative difficult. Parents should consult a registered dietitian nutritionist about which foods and beverages are best based on their child’s needs. When foods and food groups are avoided, important nutrients may be lacking and an RDN can help to ensure that nutritional needs are being met.

Get Creative to Meet Nutrient Needs

It's possible to get calcium, potassium, vitamin A, vitamin D and protein through a variety of foods and beverages. However, there can be differences in the amount of nutrients, such as calcium, that the body absorbs from plants and fortified foods. Eating a variety of healthful foods can help with meeting nutrient needs.

Here are some tips to obtain these key nutrients from non-dairy food sources:

Read the Nutrition Facts labels on foods such as whole-grain cereals to find those that are fortified with nutrients like calcium and vitamin D.

Add fruit, such as sliced banana, to hot cereal for additional potassium and stir in almond butter for some calcium.

Blend kale or other dark leafy greens, which provide calcium, with frozen fruit when making a smoothie.

Substitute canned salmon for tuna in sandwiches at lunch for extra calcium. (Two weekly servings of fish that are lower in mercury are recommended for children, but the amount of the serving depends on their age.)

Serve dark-green vegetables such as bok choy or broccoli as a side dish or mix in casseroles or soups at dinner for some additional calcium.

Add cooked beans to dishes, serve them mashed or use them to thicken soups as another source of calcium, as well as protein.

Reviewed:November 08, 2024","A long-celebrated holiday among Jewish people, Hanukkah, or Chanukah, means “dedication” and commemorates the rededication of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem. This rededication occurred after a small group called the Maccabees defeated a Syrian-Greek army under Antiochus after fighting three years to free Jews from oppression in 164 B.C.E.

During the rededication of the Temple, there was only enough oil to burn the Menorah for one day, but miraculously the oil lasted for eight nights. In honor of this, the Hanukkah celebration lasts eight days, starting on the 25th day of Kislev on the Hebrew calendar, which occurs in December or sometimes late November.

How Hanukkah is Celebrated

Lighting the menorah: A menorah holds eight candles, plus one more called the shamash, which is used to light the other candles. On the first night, the first candle on the left is lit, and one more candle is added and lit each night. The menorah may be placed in a window to share its light with neighbors.

Gifts: Each night during Hanukkah, children may receive one gift or money called Hanukkah gelt. Gelt can also be chocolate coins wrapped in brightly colored foil with Jewish symbols.

Dreidel: A dreidel is a spinning top with four sides. The dreidel game is played with candy, pennies or chocolate coins. Players put in or receive items according to each spin. Each side of the dreidel has a letter of the alphabet, which spells out “Nes Gadol Haya Sham” or “a great miracle happened there,” referring to Israel.

Traditional Hanukkah Foods

Symbolic fried foods are prepared to commemorate the miracle of the oil lasting for eight nights:

Potato latkes (pronounced “lat-kas”), or potato pancakes, are made from shredded potatoes, eggs, onions, flour or matzo meal and salt and pepper. The ingredients are combined, then pressed thin like pancakes and fried. Traditionally, latkes are fried in goose fat; however, oil is more commonly used today. Latkes are served with sour cream or applesauce. Although less traditional, for variety, latkes can be made using other root vegetables in place of or in combination with potatoes.

Sufganiyotare donuts that are popular in Israel and the United States. They are a little smaller and wider than typical American donuts and are filled with jelly, cheese or other flavors and topped with powdered sugar. Apple fritters are another popular Hanukkah treat.

Family celebrations may include traditionalAshkenazic(Eastern European) foods for main courses, such as beef brisket, roasted chicken,kugel(noodle pudding) andchallah(a braided bread).Rugelachis a favorite dessert made with a cream cheese dough and rolled with cinnamon and sugar inside.Sephardic(originally from Spain) favorites include lamb, rice and chickpeas.

Nutrition Tips

Individuals with health concerns may be watching their intake of certain nutrients more closely this time of year. Some traditional foods enjoyed at Hanukkah tend to be higher in fat, since they are fried. The sodium content also may be high if using a boxed latke mix or premade frozen latkes. Using olive oil in place of animal fats or making latkes using an air fryer or oven can reduce their saturated fat content. For individuals looking to reduce added sugars, unsweetened applesauce can be served with latkes.

Remember, it’s important to focus on the overall intake of foods and beverages throughout the year. During a holiday, consider including salads, vegetables and fruit for dessert, if these foods are lacking, to balance out meals and sweets.

Although religious and cultural observances may include foods and traditions which differ from current dietary advice, individuals can find ways to take part in these celebrations. If eating habits during a holiday are a concern to you or your family, consider speaking with aregistered dietitian nutritionist. RDNs are food and nutrition experts, and they can offer healthful eating advice while still honoring food preferences and customs.

Encourage kids to select balanced choices at lunch or help them pack one. Promote a supportive environment and get everyone together for dinner at least a few times a week.

Remember to put the focus on health, not weight.Kids and teenagers are very observant and tend to repeat things they hear or see. Try to avoid making comments about your weight in front of them as it can overemphasize looks and undervalue health.

Encourage a healthy eating style by following MyPlate recommendations at meals.Aim to make half your plate fruits and vegetables, a quarter grains and the remaining quarter protein. Add a serving of low-fat or fat-free dairy or calcium-fortified alternative to complete the meal.

Fitness and Wellness

Get active.Add physical activity whenever you can into your day, whether it's taking a family walk after dinner, playing catch or turning on music and dancing around the living room. Remember, children and teens should get 60 minutes or more of physical activity per day, and adults should get two and a half hours per week.

Reduce your family's risk of food poisoning by encouraging good food safety habitssuch as washing hands before every meal. Having kids and teens help in the kitchen can be a great way to teach them about food safety.

Stay positive!Even if you struggle to work in physical activity or to finish your vegetables, set a good example. Your child is listening to everything you say, even if you think they're ignoring you.

Be Prepared

Make sure — before an outage — that the refrigerator is set below 40ºF. Stock up on nonperishable foods that don't require refrigeration, and choose single-serve sizes if available to avoid the need for refrigeration of unused portions. Consider these easy, nutritious, shelf-stable foods:

Breads and Grains: single-serving boxes of whole-grain cereal, trail mix, energy bars, granola bars, cereal bars, bagels, crackers and popcorn

Fruits and Vegetables: carrot and celery sticks and other cut-up raw vegetables, grapes, single-serve applesauce, whole fruit (apples, peaches, bananas), dried fruit mix and juice boxes

Dairy: single-serve milk or soy beverage boxes and non-refrigerated pudding cups

Meat and Other Protein Sources: cans of tuna, peanut butter (for sandwiches or with celery and apples), nuts and single-serve packages of peanut butter and crackers.

When the Power Goes Out

During a power outage, keep the refrigerator and freezer doors closed and open them only when necessary. If power is restored within four hours, items in the refrigerator should be safe to eat. A full freezer will stay at freezing temperatures for two days if the door remains closed. A half-full freezer will stay at freezing temperatures for one day if the door remains closed.

Once the Power is Restored

When power is restored, check the temperature inside of your refrigerator and freezer. If it has risen to 45ºF or higher, discard any potentially spoiled foods. Such foods include meat, poultry, fish, dairy and egg products, soft cheese, cooked beans, cooked rice, cooked potatoes, cooked pasta, potato salad, custard and pudding. Allow time for the refrigerator to reach below 40ºF before restocking. And, of course, when in doubt, throw it out.",home-food-safety

As you make the move from cooking indoors to outside, make sure your food safety skills travel with you. After all, food safety doesn’t just apply in the kitchen — the same rules apply at the grill, especially when it comes to preventing cross-contamination.

During grilling season, cross-contamination, a leading cause of food poisoning, tops the list of food safety concerns. When juices from raw meats or bacteria from unclean items touch cooked or ready-to-eat foods, cross-contamination can occur, spreading harmful bacteria that can make you sick. Learn how to reduce your risk of food poisoning with these five rules of separation.

Rule #1: Always Start with a Clean Grill.

Follow the manufacturer's instructions to clean your grill. Removing charred food debris from the grill reduces exposure to bacteria.

Rule #2: Use Separate Plates for Uncooked and Cooked Foods.

Do not put cooked foods back on plates that originally held raw foods. Always wash plates or serving trays in hot soapy water between uses or, better yet, use separate plates: one for bringing raw meat, poultry and seafood to the grill and a clean plate for taking cooked foods off the grill.

Rule #3: Clean Utensils or Use Separate Utensils as You Grill.

After using tongs or spatulas to put raw meats, seafood or poultry on the grill, clean them thoroughly with hot soapy water before using them again to remove cooked foods. If it is too much to clean utensils while working the grill, use two sets of utensils: one for raw meats and the other set for cooked foods.

Rule #4: Marinate Mindfully — Before, During and After Grilling.

Pause before reusingmarinadethat was on raw meats, seafood or poultry for cooked foods. Always boil any leftover marinade, before using it on cooked meats, to destroy harmful bacteria. An even better practice is to plan ahead, before you grill, and make extra marinade. Use part to marinate the raw food and set aside a separate portion to use on cooked foods. While you are at the grill, never use the same brush to baste both raw and cooked meats with the marinade. Always use a different brush or one that has been washed in hot soapy water.

Rule #5: Leave the Dishtowels in the Kitchen.

Using the same dishtowel multiple times to wipe your hands and clean up spills at the grill can spread bacteria. Instead, prevent cross-contamination by using paper towels or disposable wipes to clean spills when grilling. Save the dishtowels for drying your clean hands and dishes.",home-food-safety

It's an increasingly important question being asked when it comes to agriculture and how we eat.In agriculture, the concept of sustainability is applied toward the production of plant and animal products using farming techniques and practices that help to conserve natural resources with minimal impact on the environment. Sustainable agriculture enables us to produce healthful food without compromising future generations' ability to do the same.Sustainable eating is about choosing foods that are healthful to our environment and our bodies. According the 2019 EAT-Lancet commission on healthy diets from sustainable food systems, a global shift toward more plant-based foods would help feed the world's growing population a nutritious and sustainable diet. This plant-based eating style includes more legumes (beans, peas, lentils, peanuts), whole grains, vegetables, fruits and nuts, and less animal-based foods, especially red meat and processed meat. Limiting refined grains and added sugars is encouraged as well.

Tips for Sustainable Eating

Unless you're a farmer, the best way to support sustainable farming is to eat sustainably. Below are some tips to get you started.Grow something.It could be herbs in a pot, tomatoes on a patio or a small plot in your yard. Not much gives you a greater appreciation for what it takes to create food than to grow your own. The process can help you gain an understanding of the factors involved in making plants thrive, the attention needed to successfully grow food and how precarious the process can be. Those insights may influence how you buy, use and dispose of food.Shop locally.Shopping locally is a fun way to support your community. It keeps your dollars in the community in which you live and can help foster a healthy environment of diversity. When you purchase foods that were grown locally, it cuts down on the amount of fuel needed to ship the food to your market.Initiate conversations about food.Talk with the farmers at your market, personnel at your grocery store and restaurateurs, or the growing number of people who are paying attention to how foods get on their plates. You can discover new tips, learn about new resources and find more local, sustainably-minded food producers and providers.Eat seasonally.Blueberries don't grow in Montana during January, yet you can still buy them ""fresh"" at this time. This means they're likely coming from far away. When possible, focus on foods that are available in season where you live and you'll be supporting sustainability efforts.Tap your tap.Liquids can be heavy items to ship around the country and lots of fossil fuel is needed to tote them. Instead of purchasing bottled beverages, use a refillable bottle and fill it with water from the tap or filter.Rethink your grocery list.Opt for foods in bulk, more minimally processed foods and more plant-based meals. These choices often require less packaging, waste, energy and water to produce them.Vote with your wallet and your fork.There's no better way to affect the direction of our food system and what grocers, restaurateurs and food companies produce and sell than to influence their bottom line. Ask your food providers to support local farmers, local producers and sustainable agriculture. Show support through your buying decisions.",planning

Bringing balance back into busy evenings is well worth the effort. Your whole family will feel better when they are eating delicious, nutritious meals together. Fortunately, there are several simple steps that can help families get a tasty dinner on the table easily and quickly. It all starts with a little planning and organization. Then, get everyone involved in preparing and serving the meal. When everybody pitches in, no one feels overwhelmed.

Here are a few easy and effective approaches to the dinnertime dilemma.

Have a Week's Worth of Menus in Mind

Whether you write them down or keep them in your head, you need five to seven kid-tested, parent-approved main dishes. Pick options that are easy to make and popular with everyone. Once you have an entrée, such as tacos, spaghetti  or slow-cooker stew, all you have to add is a vegetable and/or fruit and perhaps a whole-grain roll to complete the meal.

Keep Your Kitchen Stocked with Quick-to-Fix Foods

Whenever you shop, look for specials on staples (rice, pasta, beans, etc.) as well as frozen and canned fruits and vegetables with little or no added salt or sugars. With a wide variety of tasty choices on hand, you'll only have to worry about the main dish when it's time to make dinner. Add fresh produce items that are in season.

Prepare Multiple Batches of Main Ingredients

If you're cooking lentils, it's just as easy to cook a double or triple batch. Freeze extra servings to reheat for tacos or casseroles. Whole grains such as brown rice and quinoa also can be batch-cooked and frozen.

Get the Whole Family Involved from Start to Finish

The evening meal doesn't have to be one person's responsibility. Even very young children enjoy getting involved in planning and preparing healthful meals. Assign age-appropriate jobs, such as choosing the fruit for dessert, mixing pre-cut vegetables into a salad, setting the table with unbreakable dishes or clearing the dishes afterwards.",planning

Published:July 24, 2023","Mid-Autumn Festival is a holiday observed during the full moon on the 15th day of the eighth month of the Chinese calendar (a lunar calendar observed over 12 to 13 months every year). Traditionally, Mid-Autumn Festival is celebrated as a harvest festival; it’s an opportunity to give thanks to crops harvested throughout the year and celebrate the moon goddess Chang’e.

There are many versions of the legend of Chang’e, some portraying her as a hero and others as disobedient. However, most legends pair her with her husband, Hou Yi, who gains fame and respect for his archery skills. Thanks to his special skills, one day, Hou Yi obtains a special elixir of immortality. However, Chang’e takes it instead and is left to spend her immortal days on the moon.

During the Mid-Autumn Festival, the moon symbolizes happiness and wholeness. It is regarded as the perfect time for relatives near and far to come together for a family reunion and hearty meal. The laughter of children fills the air as families admire the beauty of the full moon, surrounded by glowing lanterns of all shapes and sizes. Historically, lanterns were spherical in shape, made of paper and lit with a candle. Today, lanterns typically are made of plastic and come in shapes such as a lobster (symbolizing mirth), butterfly (longevity) and star fruit (spirituality).

Foods of Mid-Autumn Festival

Celebrations often revolve around food, and Mid-Autumn Festival — also known as the Mooncake Festival — is no exception. Mooncakes are round, sweet pastries that symbolize union and are traditionally given as gifts to family and friends. The cakes typically contain a filling, such as lotus seed paste and duck egg yolk or sweet red bean paste. Mooncakes are a high-calorie dessert that are best served sliced into pieces and shared. Variations, such as ice cream- or chocolate-filled mochi-skinned mooncakes, have gained popularity in recent years.

Other popular Mid-Autumn Festival foods include lotus root, pomelo, melons and snails. Cooked pumpkin is considered an essential dish during the festival. Taro, a starchy tuber, is believed to dispel bad luck and bring good luck and wealth.",cultural-cuisines-and-traditions

Plus, because mushrooms impart a fifth taste sense called umami, which is savory, hearty and ""meat-like,"" mushrooms are an economical and nutritious way to enhance your meal.

Mushroom Nutrition

Depending on the variety, one cup of raw sliced mushrooms generally has between 15 and 40 calories and can vary in the amount of nutrients it has to offer. For example, some varieties, such as shiitake and cremini are an excellent source of copper and selenium. Some mushrooms, like oyster mushrooms, have significant amounts of three B-complex vitamins: riboflavin, niacin and pantothenic acid. The B vitamins help release energy from the fat, protein and carbohydrates in food. Mushrooms also can be excellent sources of vitamin D if they have been exposed to ultraviolet light after harvesting.

Types of Mushrooms

There are around 2,000 varieties of edible mushrooms, although only a few are commercially available. They come in many shapes, sizes and textures. Some of the most common edible mushrooms include:

Agaricus (White or Button):White button are the most common mushrooms to appear on grocery store shelves. They have a mild taste and can be used in just about anything from salads to sauces.

Chanterelles:Chanterelles are funnel- or trumpet-shaped mushrooms with a fruity, apricot-like aroma and mild, peppery taste. Most are yellow or orange.

Crimini or Baby Bellas:Crimini look similar to the white button, but are a little darker in color and have a stronger taste.

Enoki or Enokitake:Enoki mushrooms are often used in Asian cuisine, particularly soups. They are long-stemmed and white, often packaged in clusters, and have a delicate flavor.

Morel:Morels have a distinctive honeycomb-like shape and vary in color from light yellow to dark brown. They are earthy in flavor and should always be cooked before eating.

Oyster:Oyster mushrooms are smooth, trumpet-shaped and have a light flavor.

Porcini:Porcini are reddish brown and have a nutty flavor. They may be available fresh or dried and both go well in a classic Italian risotto.

Portobello:Portobellos are larger, firmer and have a meatier taste. They make great stand-ins for burgers — try marinating portobello caps in Italian dressing and then grilling or baking.

Shiitake:Like portobellos, shiitakes have a meatier flavor. Some people are sensitive to raw shiitake mushrooms. To reduce your chance of side effects, cook them when using in recipes.

One word of caution: Don't pick and eat mushrooms in the wild that you don't know are safe. There are many poisonous mushrooms that look very similar to safe mushrooms.

Cooking with Fungi

Mushrooms provide plenty of opportunity in the kitchen. Try grilling, stir-frying and sautéing. Mushrooms can enhance certain dishes, but also can be a tasty substitute for meat in your entrees. Chop them up and mix them in lasagnas, spaghetti, chili, even mixed with ground beef to make a burger that's part mushroom and part ground beef. Some other ideas to incorporate mushrooms on your plate:

Cook mushrooms in sauces and pair with whole-grain pasta dishes.

Combine mushrooms and vegetables in whole-grain wraps.

Skewer mushrooms, peppers, squash and tomatoes; then, grill until slightly charred.

Top a pizza or fill an omelet with mushrooms.

Add dried mushrooms to risotto dishes and soups.

Selection, Storage and Prep Tips

Choose mushrooms with a firm texture, even color and tightly closed caps. They can be stored in the refrigerator in a paper bag, or a partially opened zipper-lock bag, for up to one week, but best used within a few days. To prep: Brush them off with your finger then rinse and pat dry with a paper towel or clean towel. Some mushrooms, such as shiitakes or enoki, should have their stems or base trimmed before cooking.",food-groups

Know the code. On the bottom of plastic food storage containers, you'll find a tiny triangle with a number (resin identification code) ranging from 1 to 7. This number indicates what the plastic is made of. In general, safer choices for food use are numbers 1, 2, 4 and 5. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends avoiding plastic containers with codes 3, 6 and 7. Plastic number 3 contains vinyl or polyvinyl chloride (PVC); 6 has polystyrene; and 7 can contain various plastics, such as Bisphenol A (BPA).The use of BPA has been banned in baby bottles, sippy cups and in the packaging of infant formulas.  However, its use in other food and beverage containers continues to be monitored and is currently considered safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  Many BPA-free plastic food and beverage containers are available today, allowing consumers to minimize their exposure to it.

However, its use in other food and beverage containers continues to be monitored and is currently considered safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  Many BPA-free plastic food and beverage containers are available today, allowing consumers to minimize their exposure to it.

Keep it cool. Though polycarbonate plastic is strong and long-lasting, it can break down over time from high temperatures and overuse. Never microwave foods in plastic food containers, including margarine tubs and restaurant carryout containers. Plastic containers from packaged microwavable meals shouldn't be reused after their initial use; they're safely designed for one-time-use only. Also avoid putting plastic containers in the dishwasher.

Recycle as appropriate. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. recycled 9% of plastic waste created in 2018. This can contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, impacting the health of the environment.

The Bottom Line

Pick plastic food containers wisely and limit their use to cold food storage. They also can be ideal for transporting food. Consider glass or stainless steel containers for cold or hot foods, instead. Since both can be cleaned and reused, they're ideal for home food storage, too.",home-food-safety

Be sure to store food in the right container for its size and storage space, at the right temperature and for the right length of time. Proper food storage will reduce your risk of food poisoning and help stretch your food dollar since your food won't spoil as quickly.

It is easy for food to get lost in the vast expanse of your refrigerator. To keep perishable food safe and out of the danger zone, you must wrap and store it properly for the appropriate amount of time.

In the Fridge

From meats to cheeses and leftovers, use these tips to ensure you are storing foods safely in the refrigerator.

Keep your refrigerator below 40°F. At this temperature, bacteria that spoil food grow slowly. Buy a refrigerator thermometer and keep it in your fridge. Also, make sure you don’t keep the refrigerator door open for too long when searching for snacks and ingredients or restocking groceries.

Leave food in its store wrapping unless the package is open and doesn’t reseal. If you have to re-wrap, seal storage containers well to prevent moisture loss and absorption of odors.

Store food quickly. Don't keep perishable food at room temperature for longer than two hours.

Avoid overloading your refrigerator because cold air needs room to circulate.

Once a week, clean out the refrigerator. Discard any questionable foods rather than risk food poisoning. When in doubt — throw it out!

If food is moldy, discard it in a bag or wrapper so mold spores don't spread. Clean the moldy food's container and the refrigerator or pantry to remove mold spores. Check items that the moldy food may have touched because mold spreads fast on fruits and vegetables.

Meat, Poultry and Fish

Keep packages of raw meat, poultry and fish in a separate plastic bag, bowl or pan on the lowest refrigerator shelf. This keeps juices from dripping onto other foods, and the lowest shelf is usually the coldest.

Use fresh meat, poultry and fish within a couple days. Toss meat, poultry or fish with an off odor, a sticky or slimy surface or discoloration.

Eggs

Eggs will stay fresher longer if you keep them in their carton, not in the egg tray or door shelf.

Use fresh eggs in the shell within three to five weeks.

Fruits and Vegetables

Refrigerate perishable fruits and vegetables such as berries, lettuce, mushrooms and herbs. Wait to wash fresh produce until just before using, and when it comes to washing produce, skip the soap and detergents as these foods can be absorbed by the food. Drying fresh produce with a paper towel after washing may also help remove additional bacteria.

Keep produce in crisper bins in the refrigerator. That helps retain moisture. If possible, keep fruit in a separate crisper from vegetables because fruit gives off ethylene gas that can shorten storage life.

While some produce can be stored at room temperature, like citrus, whole melons and potatoes; cut, peeled or cooked fruits and vegetables should always be refrigerated.

Fresh Dairy Products

Refrigerate all dairy products promptly and preferably in the back of the refrigerator where it's colder. Cover well so they don't pick up other odors.

Once milk is poured, never return it to its original container because it can be contaminated with outside organisms that cause spoilage and food poisoning.

Grains and Canned Foods

If stored properly in airtight containers, whole-grain flour will keep for 3 to 6 months in a cool, dry pantry shelf or 6 to 8 months in the freezer.

Once canned foods have been opened, transfer them to a clean, covered container before refrigerating. You can refrigerate opened canned foods in the can if covered, but flavor may be affected.

Leftovers

Refrigerate promptly to ensure leftovers don't enter the danger zone between 40°F and 140°F.

For large amounts of leftovers, store them in several small, shallow containers to cool faster.

Carefully date leftovers and keep them at the front of the refrigerator where you can see them and use them right away.

Discard all leftovers in the refrigerator after four days. Some leftovers can be stored in the freezer for later use.

Remove as much air as possible from storage bags to keep foods fresh longer. The less you handle food, the better.

But between the cotton candy, chili cheese fries and nachos, you may think your family is destined for a day of nutritionally empty meals and snacks. Eating well at an amusement park can seem like an impossible feat, but it doesn't have to be. You may be surprised by how many nutritious food and beverage options amusement parks provide.

Scout It Out

While you're walking through the park, keep your eyes open for nutritious options. Go for a grilled chicken breast sandwich with a side salad or corn on the cob. Or, squeeze in a serving or two of vegetables with a veggie burger, salad or grilled vegetable skewers.

BYO Snacks

Just because you'll be at the park from dawn until dusk doesn't mean you have to eat every meal there. Before you leave, serve a healthy breakfast at home. That way you'll know your family started the day fueled up and ready to go. At the park, fill in with nutritious snacks from home. A few well-planned snacks may help cut down on the number of meals you'll have to buy and the amount of time you spend waiting in line for food. Portable foods such as nuts and fruit make great snacks for children and parents alike. If the park you're visiting doesn't allow you to bring in food from outside, you can still snack right. Many amusement parks now stock nutritious nibbles such as fresh fruit cups, yogurt and even carrot and celery sticks.

Sip Smart

It's important to drink enough water to prevent dehydration, and remember that you'll need to drink more when it is hot outside. Bring your own refillable bottle from home, if allowed. Or, encourage kids to hang on to their empty water bottles and refill them throughout the day rather than tossing them in the trash.

Don't Cave

Nothing's more frustrating than listening to your kids pester you for kettle corn, giant pretzels and funnel cake. While there's certainly room for the occasional treat, don't feel that you have to say yes to everything. Establish the eating routine for the day before you leave for the park and be sure to bring or scout out nutritious snack options so kids don't go hungry.

But You Can Indulge a Little

If most of the day's meals and snacks are healthy, it's completely OK for kids to have a treat. But rather than snacking while walking through the park, encourage your children to sit down and savor their food; they may find they enjoy it more. If you are going to have a treat, try to save it for later in the day. That way you won't feel like your kids stuffed themselves with not-so-nutritious food the minute you got to the park and you can focus on what really matters: the fun!",planning

Stay within your grocery budget while feeding your family well by following these 10 tips.

Don't shop when you're hungry.It may be more tempting to make impulse purchases, especially on less nutritious items that cost more, when shopping on an empty stomach.

Make a shopping list and stick to it.Plan in advance and make a menu of meals for the week — check what you have at home first, so you know what you need and don't overbuy. A list can help you avoid buying more than you plan to eat and wasting food that may spoil.

Organize your list into sections according to the layout of the supermarket.This can help cut down on the time and the number of passes you need to make through the aisles.

Check for supermarket specials.Check the weekly store circulars for sales and coupons for items you regularly purchase or that are on your grocery list for the week. Also, look at company websites and apps for coupons. Check for in-store deals like ""manager's specials"" of day-old bread or foods close to their expiration date.

Shop the bulk foods aisle.Many stores offer bulk herbs, spices, nuts, dried fruits, whole grains, dried beans and other items at discounted prices. Sometimes these are foods in a less processed form, which means you are getting an added bonus of healthy options for less money.

Stock up on staples when they go on sale.Browse grocery aisles or weekly flyers for sale items and stock up on foods you can keep in the pantry and freezer. Look for non-perishables such as canned and bottled goods; dried beans and peas; whole-grain pastas, crackers and cereals; brown rice; tomato sauces and nut butters.

Think canned and frozen.Canned and frozen fruits and vegetables often are less expensive than their fresh counterparts. Plus, they're great to have on hand when you're short on fresh options. Fruits and veggies are canned at their peak of nutrition and quality. Be sure to choose no-salt-added, no-sugar-added or less sodium varieties.

Use a slow cooker.This handy kitchen appliance uses a moist heat method of cooking which helps tenderize less expensive but tougher cuts of meat. Stretch that dollar further by adding frozen vegetables or beans to your slow cooker recipes. Meals from a slow cooker are hearty and filling, and they make the house smell good!

Cook meals in large batches, then freeze for later.Batch cook and freeze meals over the weekend when you have more time. On weekdays, all you have to do is take a meal out of the freezer and simply reheat it. You also can use leftovers from a roast or chicken to make a stir-fry, tacos or soup other days of the week.

Take advantage of loyalty cards, store brands, coupons and specials.If you haven't signed up for your grocery store's loyalty card, do it now. Sometimes sale prices are only valid with the loyalty card and you could miss out on big savings. Consider purchasing the store brand of packaged foods — they usually are a better value than commercially branded items.",planning

Raw sprouts

Unwashed fresh vegetables (including lettuce and salads)

Hot dogs, deli and luncheon meats that have not been reheated to 165°F

Unpasteurized, refrigerated pâtés or meat spread

*Raw cookie dough that does not use eggs may still be a high-risk food if it contains flour.

Choose Lower-Risk Foods

Lower-risk options are available for many of the foods listed above. These include:

Meat, poultry and shellfish cooked to safe internal temperatures

Packaged salad dressings and condiments, such as Caesar dressing and mayonnaise made with pasteurized eggs or pasteurized egg products

Pasteurized milk, cheese and eggnog

This same serving of bison is an excellent source of vitamin B12and a good source of iron.Since it is leaner than other red meat, bison easily can be overcooked. Braising or stewing work best with large, less tender cuts, such as the brisket. Broiling, grilling and pan frying are ideal for thinner cuts, including sirloin tip and inside round steaks. Enjoy ground bison in hamburgers, chilies, meatballs, pasta sauces, fajitas, nachos and stroganoff. Bison also can be substituted for beef in most dishes.Found in farmers markets, local supermarkets or specialty stores, bison also is sold by numerous online companies.

Before you reheat and eat, follow these simple steps to reduce your risk of food poisoning.

Do not let leftovers sit at room temperature for longer than two hours.

Store leftovers that need reheating in the fridge (set at 40°F or below according to a refrigerator thermometer) in a clean, airtight container. Many leftovers can also be stored in a freezer (set to 0°F).

Reheat leftovers to 165°F. A food thermometer is the only reliable way to ensure safety and determine the doneness of cooked foods.

Be sure to label leftovers to keep track of when they were made. And remember, when in doubt, throw it out!

What Type of Meal Reheater are You?

Refrigerator Raider.When it comes to refrigerators, many Americans don’t know what temperature to set theirs to. Don’t let bacteria shorten your leftovers' life — use a refrigerator thermometer to make sure your fridge is always set below 40°F.

Repeater Eater.Many people reheat leftovers before eating them — versus nibbling them cold right out of the fridge. But do you use a food thermometer to ensure doneness of reheated leftovers? Next time you reheat,use a food thermometerto make sure food reaches the proper internal temperature of 165°F before you eat.

Pizza Prowler.Believe it or not, some people admit to eating leftover pizza from the night before… when it hasn’t been refrigerated overnight! Pizza, like all perishable foods, follows the two-hour rule: If pizza has been sitting at room temperature for more than two hours, toss it!

Doggie Bag Diner.Who says you can’t take it with you? When eating out, many restaurant patrons leave at least some of the time with a doggie bag or leftovers to eat for another meal. If you’re a doggie bag diner, write the date of purchase on your take-out container — and remember to discard leftovers within three to five days.

Microwave Maniac.The most popular use formicrowavesis reheating leftovers. If your microwave isn’t equipped with a turntable, you may need to take extra precautions to make sure leftover food is cooked throughout. First, make sure to cover foods before reheating. When cooking in the microwave, rotate food one-half turn midway through the heating time and give it a stir to eliminate cold spots where bacteria can survive. Then let food stand for at least two minutes before inserting a food thermometer to ensure food has reached the proper internal temperature of 165°F.

Dinner Defroster.Nearly half of Americans use their microwaves to defrost frozen meat. Since juices from raw meat may carry harmful bacteria, dinner defrosters should take special precautions to avoid cross-contamination. Use separate plates — one to defrost meat and another to serve cooked meat — or wash plates in warm, soapy water between uses to eliminate bacteria.",home-food-safety

Rosh Hashanah begins at sunset on the first day of the seventh Hebrew month,Tishrei, which usually falls in September. During this time, you can wish Jewish people “Shanah Tovah” (pronounced shaNAH toe-VAH), which means “a good year.”

Leading up to the High Holidays, ashofar(an instrument made from a ram’s horn) blast is sounded every day in the synagogue for the month ofElul, beforeTishrei. Then, on Rosh Hashanah, specific blasts are sounded during the service 100 times each day.

Like most Jewish holidays, Rosh Hashanah begins at sundown the night before the day of the holiday. It is celebrated for two days among Conservative and Orthodox Jews, and often just one day for Reform Jews. This holiday commemorates the beginning of the creation of the world.

People may attend late services at the synagogue on the night before Rosh Hashanah and, on both days, they follow a prayer book called theMakhzor. No work may be done during the entire holiday. On the first afternoon, participants go to a body of water for thetachlichceremony, which includes emptying pockets to represent letting go of sin.

Traditional Foods

Families traditionally enjoy a large dinner for two nights to celebrate the holiday. Sweet foods are served for a pleasant year ahead. Other symbolic foods include:

Round challah: Challah is a braided wheat bread made with eggs and honey. For Rosh Hashanah, it is often made with raisins for extra sweetness and braided in a circle to represent the eternal nature of life. In Ukraine, the challah may be shaped like a bird to send prayers heavenward.

Whole fish with the head: A whole fish with the head may be served to represent the “head of the year” and the hope “that God makes you as the head and not the tail,” which is from the Torah.

Gefilte fish: These patties are made with carp or other white fish, matzo meal, carrots and celery, and are often served as an appetizer.

Carrot tzimmes(pronounced sim-miss): Stewed carrot slices with onions, prunes, honey, fruit juice and warm spices, such as cinnamon and ginger, are a favorite combination. The Yiddish word for carrots, meiren, means to multiply, which corresponds to “go forth and multiply” in Genesis.

New fruit: A fruit that has not been consumed since last year (or the last time it was in season) might be served such as apples or pears.

Pomegranate: The fruit is supposed to have 613 seeds, the same number of commandments in the Torah and mitzvot, or good deeds, that the Jewish people are encouraged to do throughout the year.

Yehi Ratzones: In the Sephardic (originally from Spain) tradition, several appetizers are served — for example, leeks, dates, spinach, black-eyed peas, fish head or cow’s cheek, pumpkin or other squash — and may be prepared in a variety of ways. Each appetizer is blessed with ayehi ratzones(“may it be God’s will”) blessing before eating.

Kugel(noodle pudding): Egg noodles are baked with cottage cheese, sour cream and eggs, sugar and fruit like cherries, apples, or raisins for a sweet version.

Lekach(honey cake): A popular Rosh Hashanah dessert from Eastern Europe,lekachmeans “portion” — by eating the cake, you hope to be blessed with a “goodly portion.”

Favorite recipes and sweet foods are popular choices for families on the first and second nights of Rosh Hashanah. Sour foods are usually avoided. Some people avoid nuts during Rosh Hashanah since the numerical value of the Hebrew letters in the word “nut” add up to the same number as the word “sin.”

During dinner, blessings are said over candles, wine and challah. The first bite of food traditionally eaten is a chunk of challah dipped in honey, followed by apple slices dipped in honey.

Common Ashkenazic (Eastern European) menu items include vegetable soup with short ribs or matzo ball soup, beef brisket, roasted turkey or chicken, sweetkugel, apples with honey, round challah, potatoes, vegetables and desserts such as honey cake and Jewish apple cake. If people adhere to Kosher dietary laws, meats including poultry and dairy foods may not be served at the same meal. Because of this, some people may choose “pareve”kugel, which means it was made without dairy. Sephardic, Mizrahi (Middle East) and Indian celebrations may include leek patties,ballahat(ground fish balls), eggplant dishes, stewed okra with meats and vegetables, andkheer(rice pudding made with coconut milk and fruit).",cultural-cuisines-and-traditions

Reviewed:June 13, 2023","Next time your kids want a snack, look to whole grains. They are not only nutritious, but also delicious!

Whole grains contain three parts: the bran, the germ and the endosperm (refined grains only contain the endosperm). Including whole grains as part of a healthy diet can help reduce the risk for heart disease, diabetes and some cancers.

Barley, quinoa, oats, brown rice, whole-grain pastas, breads and cereals are just some of the whole-grain foods available. When reading food labels, look for the words ""whole grain"" in the ingredient list. Also, choose products high in dietary fiber with fewer added sugars.

Be a savvy consumer when buying whole grains — the words multi-grain, stone-ground, 100% wheat, cracked wheat, seven-grain and bran don't necessarily indicate a whole-grain food. Color also is not a reliable way to pick a whole-grain product. Sometimes molasses or other added ingredients give a food that nice brown color.

There are many tasty, kid-tested, whole-grain snack options. Half of a whole-grain pita pocket stuffed with ricotta cheese and Granny Smith apple slices with a dash of cinnamon is a great small bite. Or, for an on-the-go snack, combine ½ cup ready-to-eat whole-grain cereal, dried fruit and nuts.

Did you know that many schools serve whole-grain options? Guidelines that schools try to follow, include:

Offering whole grains with at least 8 grams or more per serving.

Buying products that include the FDA-approved whole-grain health claim on its packaging.

Making sure that product ingredient lists state whole grains first.

Try swapping out refined grains and white breads and pastas for whole-grain varieties. To gradually introduce whole grains to someone in your family, combine whole-grain foods and the refined grain foods they’re used to until their palate has adjusted to whole grains. Aim to make at least half of a day’s grains whole grains.",food-groups

The Jewish religious holiday often brings with it bigger meals, later mealtimes, sweet treats, socialized eating with loved ones and less physical activity. For individuals who are concerned about holiday traditions affecting their eating habits, rest assured, there are ways to eat healthfully during Passover.

Choose Whole Grains

Whole grains are fantastic carbohydrate choices for your health because they keep you full and satisfied. Luckily, several whole-grain products are permitted during Passover, including spelt, farfel, whole-wheat matzo and whole-wheat matzo meal. Quinoa is another increasingly popular — and permitted — food that can be incorporated into your meal served as a grain.

Eat Breakfast

Eating a balanced breakfast may help prevent overeating at later meals. Instead of eating five pieces of matzo with cream cheese on Passover mornings, choose plain Greek yogurt mixed with fresh fruit and a few small pieces of whole-wheat matzo for added crunch. Another great choice comes right off the leftovers of your Seder table: the hard-boiled egg. Or, try an omelet with added vegetables for a source of protein and some dietary fiber.

Aim for Balance

While you may not be able to avoid eating the late-night feast during theSeders, you can aim for balanced meals throughout the day to prevent overeating in the evening. Choose moderate portions of fruit and vegetables with low-fat dairy or a lean protein food for your meals and snacks to help you meet different nutrient needs for the day.

Plan for Dessert

If you choose to include treats, be sure you are making a mindful choice. It’s easy to overeat and reach for more on an impulse.

Strategize the Meal

To maintain a balanced, portion-controlled meal, fill half your plate with vegetables and fruit, about one-quarter with lean protein and one-quarter whole grains. And, take your time while eating. By eating more slowly, you give your brain time to register that you are full and satisfied before overeating.

Stay Active

You may find it difficult to get a full workout in during Passover but movement is just as important during holidays as it is every day of the year. Try incorporating physical activity into your day in practical ways, such as short walks.",cultural-cuisines-and-traditions

McDonald, RD;Lenora Moragne, PhD, MS, RD; andSarah Wilder, PhD, RD— here are six ways we all can celebrate Black History Month.

Read Black Authors.There is a plethora ofbooks and resourcesavailable — including non-fiction, fiction, cookbooks, children's literature and poetry — that offer a wealth of information and insight into the Black experience. Most local libraries are celebrating Black History Month with curated collections of titles for all ages and reading levels. Online and brick and mortar bookstores also are excellent resources, with suggested book club selections and online reviews and ratings available.

Follow Black Content Creators.If you're on social media, whether it be Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Snapchat or TikTok, now is a great time to follow Black content creators. You can start with professional historians associated with museums, libraries and universities for credible historical references; Black registered dietitian nutritionists and health professionals for nutrition information or recipes; or everyday creators sharing their experiences and stories. Once you follow a few Black creators, most platform algorithms will start suggesting other similar creators.

Look for Black History Collections on Streaming Video Platforms.The biggest streaming video platforms — as well as free video collections online — are promoting collections to celebrate Black History Month, including documentaries, biographies and biopics, and dramas, satire and comedies sharing Black experiences and starring or directed by Black artists.

Learn about the history of Black Americans' work.The 2025 Black History Month theme is ""African Americans and Labor."" According to theAssociation for the Study of African American Life and History, this theme ""focuses on the various and profound ways that work and working of all kinds — free and unfree, skilled, and unskilled, vocational and voluntary — intersect with the collective experiences of Black people.""

Support Black Health and Wellness and Advocate for Health Equity.Black Americans experiencehigher ratesof many illnesses, such as diabetes and hypertension, plus higher rates of death from these illnesses. There also is a disproportionate amount ofmaternal and infant mortalityamong Black Americans. In the U.S., access to health care for Black people is often subpar due to severalsocial determinants of health, such as a lack of safe transportation. Support Black health and wellness and health equity through volunteerism and advocacy. The Academy's vision is a world where all people thrive through the transformative power of food and nutrition.

According to the 2020-2025Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the majority of children in the U.S. don't meet the daily recommended intake of 2½ cups of vegetables and 1½ to 2 cups of fruit. Many children are picky eaters, and a study in theJournal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatryfound that picky eaters tend to avoid vegetables.

Food offers a world of experiences well suited to how children learn. Because food can become a hands-on activity, everyday tasks can get kids involved in food, which can help promote healthful eating. Try some of these simple ways to explore fruits and vegetables with young children!

Let Your Child Explore

Plan a fun trip to a grocery store orfarmers marketwith your child. Allowing children to have a say in what produce is picked can be helpful in encouraging them to eat it once you are home. Here are a few creative activities to try.

Beforehand, give your child cookbooks or cooking magazines and have them look for recipes they would like to try. For older children, you can even ask them to help plan a meal.

While shopping, allow them to pick out their favorite apples, broccoli or whichever produce interests them.

As you walk the store aisles, encourage children to name the fruits and vegetables in the produce, canned food or frozen food aisle, or to say the colors of foods they know.

Find foods that are new to them; talk about their color, shape, size and feel.

Take advantage of food samples when you are at the store to taste-test new foods.

Use the experience to sharpen math skills. If oranges are four for a dollar, how much does it cost to buy six?

Let Children Choose

Once children have explored all the produce, let them choose a vegetable or fruit to take home and try. Discuss how they would like it prepared. Younger children can bag up the produce, and older children can weigh it and calculate the cost. Challenge them to put one item of each color in the cart: white cauliflower, blue blueberries, orange carrots, green spinach, etc.

Try Growing Your Own Produce

Growing your own food from seeds in your garden can be a rewarding experience. Perhaps start the seeds in paper cups on your windowsill.Kids enjoy eating foods they grow themselves— and it's a great science lesson!

Your Child Can Help At Home Too!

At home, as you take vegetables out of grocery bags, talk about on which part of the plant each one grows: leaf (cabbage, lettuce, greens), roots (carrot, potato), stalk (celery, asparagus), flower (broccoli, cauliflower, artichoke) and seed (peas, corn). Kids are more likely to try a food that they have a hand in choosing and preparing. Children love to help! Depending on their age and skill level, children can participate in various meal preparation tasks such as:

Washing vegetables

Rinsing berries

Tearing lettuce

Slicing fruits and vegetables

Cooking with the microwave oven

Putting bread in a basket

Explore Beyond Your Kitchen

Take your food exploration beyond your kitchen and local grocery store by reading books about food to children. Ask a librarian, teacher or head of the children's book department in a store to suggest titles and prepare some foods from the stories.",food-groups

Published:March 01, 2023
Reviewed:February 20, 2023","Each May since 2006, Americans have celebrated Jewish American Heritage Month in recognition of the more than 350-year history of Jewish contributions. President George W. Bush proclaimed May to be Jewish American Heritage Month after unanimously passing in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.

The American Jewish community has helped shape American culture with influences in politics, entertainment, arts, philanthropy, education, food, commerce and more. As of 2020, an estimated 7.6 million Jews live in the United States, which is 2.4% of the population; according to the American Jewish Population Project, just under half live in three states: New York, California and Florida.

While Judaism is a religion, 1.2 million Jewish adults identify as having no religion, according to the AJPP's report. Non-religious Jews identify with the culture including the food, language, holiday observances and traditions, plus the shared history of the Jewish people. In traditional Jewish law, anyone whose biological mother was a Jew or anyone who has gone through a formal conversion to Judaism is considered a Jew.

During May and throughout the year, celebrate Jewish Americans by learning more about the holidays, culture and food traditions of Jewish people.

Celebrated Holidays

The Jewish calendar follows a lunar calendar, where months are based on the number of days it takes the moon to go through all its phases — new moon to full and back to new. A lunar month is approximately 29.5 days. The Gregorian calendar, which is followed across much of the world, is a solar calendar based on the number of days it takes the Earth to orbit completely around the sun. To stay in sync with the seasons, the Jewish calendar adds a leap month every couple of years. Additionally, holidays start at sundown on the night before it appears on most American calendars.

Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, typically falls in September and is very important to Jews. Ten days later is the very solemn day, Yom Kippur. This is the day of atonement, when religious Jews fast and repent from sundown to sundown. Often Jews break their fast with a meal shared with friends and family shortly after the sun sets.

Another important holiday in the Jewish calendar isSukkot, the week-long ""festival of booths"" that commemorates the Biblical period of wandering in the desert. Jews celebrate by building a temporary shelter called asukkahand sharing meals with friends and family inside of it.

Passover, which occurs in the spring, is next in the calendar. This celebration lasts for a week and commemorates the Jews' Exodus from Egypt. The Passover meal is called aseder, which means ""order."" Duringseder, various foods are eaten in sequence, or order, as described in a book called theHaggadah, which tells the story of the Exodus and serves as a script to theseder.

Chanukah(also spelledHanukkah), an eight-day holiday celebrated in the winter around the same time as Christmas, is also known as the ""Festival of Lights"" in honor of the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem.

Food and the Meaning of Kosher

In everyday slang, kosher means ""allowed."" If something is kosher, it's OK. The word ""kosher"" comes from the Hebrew wordkasher, which means ""fit."" A food that's fit to be eaten by a Jew, as described in the Hebrew Bible, is kosher. Such a food must be prepared and eaten in specific ways. For example, the animals from which the food comes must have been raised and slaughtered humanely, and meat and dairy cannot be eaten together. Today's understanding of the latter rule is that eating both the animal and its mother's milk is insulting to the animal.

Jews that closely observe kosher guidelines have separate dishes and cooking utensils for meat and dairy products. Other rules may be followed for reasons related to cleanliness. For example, a Jew who follows kosher eating laws would not eat shrimp or other shellfish because they are ""bottom-crawlers"" and are believed to be ""unclean."" Similarly, pork is not allowed because it was once deemed ""unclean.""

Like the foods of other cultures, traditional Jewish foods may vary by geographical region. Traditional Jewish foods in Germany, France and Eastern Europe might include bagels, lox, dill pickles and chicken soup. In the Middle East, Spain, Portugal or Africa, a different set of traditional foods may be served, including stuffed eggplant and other vegetables, pickled vegetables, lamb, nuts, falafel, chickpeas, olives and stuffed grape leaves.

As with many cultures, some Jewish foods might seem similar to other foods. For example,blintzesare filled pancakes similar to crepes.Kreplachare small dumplings, similar to a pierogi or wonton, and aknishis similar to a hand-pie or larger dumpling, not unlike an empanada.

The lunar calendar determines the date of the Lunar New Year, with the first day aligning with the new moon that appears between January 21 and February 20.

The festival's history can be traced back 3,500 years and is thought to have originated in the Shang Dynasty, but customs and traditions have since evolved. The tale is that the Chinese New Year stemmed from an ancient battle against a mythical beast,Nian. To scare away the beast and prevent destruction, people displayed red paper, lit firecrackers and wore red clothing. These traditions continue today.

Food Traditions

The 15 days of Lunar New Year festivities are meant to be celebrated with loved ones. Food plays a significant role, with families thoughtfully creating menus and selecting dishes that will provide blessings in the new year.

Symbolic foods commonly eaten include:

Dumplings that resemble the shape of ancient money to represent wealth

Nian gao(glutinous rice cakes) for hope that the new year will be better than those past

Sweet rice balls symbolize family togetherness and unity

Spring rolls that look like bars of gold to symbolize wealth

Noodles for happiness and a long life — the longer the noodles, the better

Steamed whole fish represents excess and prosperity

Steamed whole chicken represents family reunion and life coming full circle

Vegetables including bamboo shoots for a long life; poria mushrooms for blessings and good fortune; and seaweed for affluence and prosperity

Fruits including muskmelon and grapefruit to represent family and hope; tangerines and oranges for good luck

Non-food Traditions

Regional customs and traditions vary but follow the same overarching theme — saying goodbye to the old and welcoming a lucky and prosperous new year.

While food plays a large role, other activities include:

Cleaning the home thoroughly before the festival to sweep away bad luck from last year and prepare the home for good luck in the new year

Decorating with red, a color that signifies good luck and happiness

Offering sacrifices to ancestors and honoring them with a place setting at the dinner table

Giving red envelopes filled with money and other gifts to children — and sometimes other family members who might be facing difficulties, such as unemployment — to ward offNianand for good luck in the new year

Firecrackers and fireworks to scare away evil and welcome the new year

Watching lion and dragon dances to bring prosperity and good luck

Wear red undergarments every day of the year to ward off evil spirits and bad fortune

Chinese Zodiac

The Chinese zodiac is a repeating cycle of 12 years. Each year is represented by an animal and its characteristics.

In order, these are the zodiac animals and their purported personality traits:

Rat: quick-witted, resourceful, financially fit and organized

Ox: dependable, hard-working, strong, patient

Tiger: brave, confident, independent

Rabbit: quiet, gentle, responsible, elegant

November provides many opportunities to learn about and celebrate Native Americans and Indigenous peoples throughout the centuries.

Large organizations and local groups offer community events focused on the history of various tribes in the Americas, as well as obstacles faced by native communities and tribal nations, such as food and water justice, land acknowledgements and repatriation. Some additional ways to observe Native American Heritage Month include learning about native plants and various types of cuisine, music, languages, arts and culture, which can vary among the more than 500 federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native tribes.

This month and throughout the year, celebrate Native Americans and Indigenous peoples who have made, and continue to make, significant contributions to public health and other areas of life.

Here are five ways we all can celebrate Native American Heritage Month:

Learn the history of Native American foods that are now eaten all over the world. It's estimated that 60% of the world's crops originated from the Americas. Learning about the cultural significance and evolution of foods previously only known by Indigenous peoples can help cultivate a deeper appreciation and understanding of their history.

Look for collections of Native American history and art. The biggest streaming video platforms — as well as free video collections online — often promote exhibits to celebrate Native American Heritage Month. One example is the Native Cinema Showcase, which is an online event hosted by theSmithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian, and features films of Native nations from various countries, including the U.S.

Read Native American authors. A variety ofbooks and resources— including nonfiction, fiction, cookbooks, children's literature and poetry — offer information and insight into the experience and culture of Native American and Indigenous people. Check your local library to find out how they are celebrating Native American Heritage Month. Many libraries will have curated collections of titles for all ages and reading levels.

Learn about and advocate for collaboration, development, diversity and inclusion. Encourage local and national governments to prioritize representation of Native Americans.

Reviewed:June 28, 2023","You can't tell if a food is safely cooked by sight, smell or even taste. A food thermometer is the only way to ensure food is cooked to the proper internal temperature and harmful bacteria are eliminated.

A food thermometer is needed for more than just meat and poultry. A safe minimum internal temperature must be reached to avoid food poisoning in all cooked foods. A food thermometer also is needed after food is cooked to ensure the temperature doesn't fall into the danger zone.

The temperature""danger zone""for perishable foods is between 40 degrees and 140 degrees Fahrenheit. Perishable foods are no longer safe to eat if they have been in this danger zone for more than two hours (one hour in 90°F or above). This is especially important for buffet and potluck-style gatherings where it’s easy to lose track of time and food may sit out for a longer period of time.

Choosing a Food Thermometer

There is a wide variety of food thermometers available. Pick the type best for you and remember to use it every time you cook:

Dial oven-safe thermometerscan remain in place as the food cooks. Insert 2 to 2½ inches deep into the thickest part of the food. Temperature readings are ready in one to two minutes. Use this type of thermometer for roasts, casseroles and soups. They are not good for thin foods.

Instant-read thermometersaren’t meant to be left in the food while it cooks. Instead, use it to check food toward the end of cooking. Place the stem about 2 to 2½ inches deep in the thickest part of the food. This thermometer reads the temperature instantly, typically in 10 to 20 seconds. Used in roasts, casseroles and soups, and inserted sideways in thin dishes.

Thermometer-fork combinationthermometers are convenient for grilling and read the temperature of foods in two to 10 seconds. Place at least ¼ inch deep in the thickest part of the food, with the sensor in the fork fully inserted.

Pop-up thermometers and disposable temperature indicatorsare meant for one-time use. These thermometers are often designed for specific temperature ranges, for example, the safe cooking temperature for hamburgers or turkey. These also read the temperature of foods quickly, in five to 10 seconds, when the material pops up or changes color. For best practice, also check the temperature of large items, such as whole turkeys, with a conventional thermometer.

How to Use a Food Thermometer

Before using a food thermometer, read the manufacturer's instructions. Read about how far to insert the thermometer in a food to get an accurate reading and whether it can remain in the food while cooking. Follow these simple steps to ensure you are correctly using a food thermometer:

Step 1: Test it.Use either ice water or boiling water to confirm your food thermometer is accurate. Either method will help determine if the thermometer needs to be calibrated.

Step 2: Calibrate it.Read the instructions to determine if the thermometer you intend to use can be calibrated. If so, it will indicate how to adjust the thermometer, as needed, to ensure you get an accurate reading.

Step 3: Place it properly.Placement is very important to get an accurate reading. Place the food thermometer in the thickest part of the food, making sure not to touch bone, fat or gristle. The temperature may need to be checked in several places depending on the size and shape of the food being cooked, such as a roast, and with egg dishes and casseroles that are made with ground meat or poultry.

Step 4: Don't rush it.Wait the recommended amount of time for your type of thermometer. For meat products including raw beef, pork, lamb, veal steaks, chops and roasts, use the food thermometer before removing meat from the heat source. For safety and quality, allow steaks, chops and roasts to rest for at least three minutes before carving or consuming.

Step 5: Take care of it.Clean your food thermometer by hand with clean, hot, soapy water after each use, being careful not to immerse it in water. Washing it right away prevents cross-contamination and the spread of harmful bacteria, especially if the food is not done and needs to be checked again with the thermometer.

Correct Food Thermometer Placement

Begin checking the temperature toward the end of cooking, but before the food is expected to be ""done.""

Using a food thermometer is only half the equation. Be sure to cook foods to the safe internal temperature. For fish, that’s 145°F or until the flesh turns opaque and flakes easily with a fork. Steaks, roasts and chops (whether they’re beef, veal, pork or lamb) should reach at least 145°F and rest for three minutes before serving. Any mixture using ground beef or pork, such as hamburgers, should reach at least 160°F, as should any egg dishes. Poultry products, whether whole or ground, should be heated to at least 165°F. Make sure leftovers and casseroles reach 165°F, too.",home-food-safety

Reviewed:March 13, 2025","Summer may be the traditional grilling season, but many Americans fire up the barbecue all year-round! Whether you're a seasonal griller or a year-round grill gourmet, beef up your food safety and nutrition with these helpful, hot-off-the-grill tips.

Develop a Taste for Safety

Buy a Food Thermometer.When selecting a thermometer, read the package label. Be sure you're buying a type designed to use with food. There are many different types of food thermometers on the market.

Clean Your Grill.Take time to make sure your grill is clean and ready for safe use before throwing on your favorite food. Clean your grill with hot, soapy water and remove any charred debris or grease buildup after each use.

Play It Safe

Keep the Upper Hand.Proper food safety involves using different cutting boards when switching between raw meats and ready-to-eat foods. Remember to change your knives and other utensils when working with these foods, too, to avoid cross-contamination. Grilling shortcuts may save time, but they also can leave you with a case of foodborne illness! Take precautions. Wash cutting boards and utensils in hot, soapy water between uses. Or, use color-coded sets to keep raw meats, seafood and poultry and ready-to-eat foods separate. And always,alwayswash your hands!

Embrace Marinating Musts.Marinate meat in the refrigerator (never on the counter or outside by the grill). And, if they’ve been used on raw meats, discard or bring leftover sauces to a boil before reusing them to prevent cross-contamination.

Prevent Charring.Although research is limited, burnt or charred foods are associated with an increased risk for cancers. Charring typically occurs due to high-temperature cooking methods such as grilling, frying and broiling. To reduce the char on your foods, cut off visible fat on meats, consider precooking meat and fish to reduce the juices that drip into the flame and limit direct exposure of meat to open flames. Areas with charring also can be scraped off before eating.

UseYour Food Thermometer.While a large percentage of Americans may have a food thermometer, only a small percent consistently uses it to check the doneness of their hamburgers, chicken breasts and other grilled favorites. Using a food thermometer can help prevent overcooking, and it’s also the only way to make sure foods reach a safe internal temperature.

Be Adventurous

Be Mindful of Fat. Choose lean cuts of beef, pork, poultry or seafood. Plant-based protein foods, such as bean or tofu patties, can be leaner options, too.

Pile on the Nutrients. Add flavor and nutrition to your meal with vegetables cooked right on the grill. Baste vegetables such as peppers, corn, eggplant or onions with a little olive oil or vinaigrette. Season them with herbs and place on a hot grill until they are tender. Or, sprinkle sliced zucchini, tomatoes and carrots with a little water and seasoning, wrap in heavy-duty aluminum foil and grill until vegetables are tender.See other vegetarian cookout ideas.

Toast a Healthy Dessert. Grill fruit kebabs, pineapple slices or peach halves on low heat until the fruit is hot and slightly golden. Serve the fruit on top of a scoop of low-fat yogurt for a tasty and nutritious dessert.

When You're Chilling

Watch the Clock.Refrigerate foods promptly and don’t leave perishable foods sitting out for more than two hours at room temperature. When surrounding temperatures are 90°F or higher, the ""two-hour rule"" becomes the ""one-hour rule."" Next time you dine outdoors, keep guests safe by setting out perishable food items in smaller portions and for one-hour shifts. Or, keep perishable foods on ice to make sure they stay properly chilled.

Remember the Condiments.Whether you’re using mayonnaise, salsa, ketchup or mustard, remember condiments also should not be left sitting out for more than two hours (one hour in temperatures above 90°F). It is a smart idea to bring a cooler or keep condiments in a bucket of ice.

Let Leftovers Go.Keeping grilled foods in the refrigerator for too long can affect their taste, quality and, more importantly, their safety. Food safety experts say leftover foods have a refrigerator life of only three to four days, so make sure your grilled leftovers are as safe as they are delicious. Refrigerate foods in shallow containers and write the date on top to help you keep track. Also, be sure to reheat foods before serving a second time around and use a food thermometer to make sure they’ve reached an internal temperature of 165°F.",food-preparation
Ways to Eat Wild Greens,https://www.eatright.org/food/food-groups/vegetables/dandelions-for-your-salad,"Contributors:Jill Kohn, MS, RDN, LDN

Reviewed:March 19, 2024","Historically, wild greens, including dandelion, lambsquarters and nettle, have been consumed by various indigenous groups in America. While many Americans may have grown up thinking plants such as dandelions are simply weeds, recent years have seen these plants catch the attention of a larger audience of chefs and people looking to eat locally.

Wild greens might appear on restaurant menus and at farmers markets, and in recipes for main dishes, soups and sides — and for good reason. Edible wild greens are flavorful, low in calories and high in vitamins, plus other nutrients, depending on the type of plant.

Wild greens are also versatile — they taste great sautéed in olive oil and in soups and casseroles, and some can be tossed raw into salads and piled on sandwiches. It's best to experiment with small amounts initially until you find which recipes suit your taste preferences.

Even though edible greens often grow in the wild, it’s generally better to buy them from a reliable source, such as a supermarket or a farmers market. Picking them yourself can be dangerous, since plants that look similar may exist and be unsafe to eat. Plus, you don't want to risk eating a plant that has been treated with chemicals, which is often the case for dandelions and other wild greens that grow on their own in neighborhoods and parks.

These are a few edible wild greens and how you can include them in your eating plan.

Lambsquarters

Lambsquarters is related to spinach and often described as being similar to it. The leaves are considered bitter and become milder when cooked. One cup of cooked lambsquarters has 464 milligrams of calcium and is a rich source of vitamins A and K. It also packs in more than 500 milligrams of potassium and is an excellent source of vitamin C.

Dandelion

Enjoy the roots, leaves and even the flowers of this common green that's hated by lawn owners and loved by cooks. The leaves are commonly found in salad mixes, such as mesclun, and are described as having a slightly bitter taste. The roots can be added to salads or roasted and ground to make a coffee substitute. From a nutritional standpoint, 1 cup of cooked dandelion greens boasts almost 150 milligrams of calcium and is an excellent source of vitamins A, C and K.

Amaranth

The amaranth plant is more commonly known for its seeds, but its leaves are edible, too. The leaves taste slightly sweet and can be eaten raw or cooked. A cup of cooked amaranth leaves provides approximately 3 milligrams of iron, 275 milligrams of calcium, 850 milligrams of potassium and almost 3 grams of protein — for only 28 calories.

Nettles

Nettles, also known as ""Stinging Nettles,"" can't be eaten raw, and you need to be careful when handling them. Using tongs or durable gloves is recommended, because the raw leaves can sting the skin. Once cooked, 1 cup of nettles boasts 6 grams of dietary fiber and close to 430 milligrams of calcium. It's a good source of magnesium and offers some iron and potassium as well.

Purslane

This super-hardy green grows almost anywhere from the garden to gravel and reproduces rather easily. While it is despised by many gardeners, purslane is actually a good source of vitamin A and potassium and has a little bit of several vitamins and minerals — including magnesium, calcium, folate and iron — all for only 21 calories per cup cooked. It’s known to impart a slightly tart or citrusy flavor, and the stems and leaves can be added to salads or slightly cooked and enjoyed as greens or in soups.

Sorrel

This perennial herb with leaves that look similar to spinach can taste sour due to its oxalic acid content. Young leaves, which have a milder flavor, can be used in salads and the older, larger leaves work best in soups and stews. Sorrel is high in vitamin A, and it also provides some magnesium, potassium and calcium.

As is the case with other dark green, leafy vegetables, wild greens can be high in vitamin K. If you're taking an anticoagulant medication (blood-thinning drug), eating consistent amounts of vitamin K is extremely important. Too much or too little can affect how your blood clots. Check with your doctor or registered dietitian nutritionist before making any changes in your diet if you are taking an anticoagulant medication.",food-groups

A Fun Alternative

Does the space you have available at home limit your ability to garden? Or, are you worried about poor soil quality and neighborhood regulations? No worries, you can still plant a container garden! Container gardening is a great way to connect kids to where their food comes from. And, eating what you grow is a fun and wonderful experience for the whole family.

Choosing a Container

Barrels and buckets work well, and some people even use items such as wheelbarrows for containers. Hanging baskets are good options for small spaces. Clay pots can work for plants that don't need much soil. Match the size of the containers to the depth and amount of soil needed for the plants you want to grow, using seed packets as references. Before using a wood container, get advice from a local hardware store about safe types to use, as some woods may be treated with harmful chemicals. Similarly, avoid using containers that previously held toxic materials.

Finding a container with adequate drainage is key. If your container doesn't have holes in it, make a few half-inch holes near the bottom to allow water to run out. This will keep plant roots from rotting. To protect surfaces, you can put a saucer under the container to catch water — be sure to empty it regularly.

Planting the Crops

Start with a mixed blend of soil for best results, and consider starting with something easy to grow — such as sugar snap peas or sweet cherry tomatoes. Or try any vegetable that your child is interested in growing. Seed packets will tell you the best times to plant different crops. You can start seedlings inside and transplant them to outdoor containers at the right time. Or, put starter plants from a greenhouse in your container.

Caring for Your Garden

When grown in containers, plants need food in the form of commercial fertilizer or compost materials. Ask the experts at your local garden center or agricultural extension program about the best options for your garden. Container plants also need water often —  up to twice per day in hot weather. Pinch off dry leaves and buds to make room for healthy new ones to thrive.

Not everyone agrees on the exact ingredients that go into the perfect stuffing. However, everyonedoesagree that stuffing needs to be prepared safely so your holiday doesn't provide vivid stories of food poisoning.

The Basics of Stuffing Preparation

To prepare stuffing safely and help ensure only fond food memories result, proper planning is key. First, determine how much stuffing you need. When serving individual-sized portions, like boneless chicken breasts, pork chops or other entrees, plan for about ½ cup of prepared stuffing per serving. If stuffing whole poultry, plan for about ½ to 1 cup of prepared stuffing per pound of uncooked poultry.

Also, you'll need a food thermometer for determining when stuffing is safely cooked to a minimum internal temperature of 165°F. Use this temperature as a guide, whether you serve stuffing separately in a casserole dish or stuffed into poultry or meat. Bacteria can survive and thrive in stuffing that hasn't reached this temperature, increasing your risk of food poisoning. While it may be traditional to cook stuffing inside of poultry or meat, it can also take longer for it to reach the appropriate temperature. For maximum safety, consider cooking stuffing in a separate dish.

Stuffing Preparation: Do's and Don'ts

Once your meal is planned and your ingredients and food thermometer are ready, deliciousness awaits. Follow these tips to help ensure you and your loved ones safely enjoy the succulence of stuffing.

As soon as you've prepped the stuffing, cook it immediately. If you prefer to pre-prep stuffing in advance, freeze rather than refrigerate the uncooked mixture.

When stuffing the large cavity of fresh or thawed whole poultry, use a moist stuffing mixture rather than a dry one. Spoon it loosely into the cavity to allow for proper cooking. Although it may be tempting, avoid over-stuffing the bird.

For stuffing recipes that include poultry, shellfish or meat, cook these raw ingredients before adding them into the stuffing.

After the inner part of the stuffed poultry thigh and the center of the stuffing have reached 165°F, let the cooked poultry stand for 20 minutes to complete the cooking process; then remove the stuffing and carve the poultry.

Refrigerate any leftover foods that are perishable within two hours.

If you have leftover stuffing cooked within the poultry cavity, store the stuffing in a separate, sealed container. You don’t need to remove the stuffing from smaller cuts of meat, like pork chops or single portion cuts of meat. Stuffing may be refrigerated for up to three or four days, or frozen for longer storage. The same timing applies for stuffing that is cooked separately, too.

Be sure to reheat any leftover stuffing and use a food thermometer to make sure it reaches 165°F once again before eating it.",cultural-cuisines-and-traditions

Scrambled parfait olé. Toast a slice of whole-grain bread. Scramble an egg. Layer in a heatproof sundae glass with chunky salsa.

Hummus fondue. Stir low-sodium vegetable broth into hummus until fondue-like. Serve cool with cubes of fresh whole-grain bread and cucumber on bamboo skewers.

Chips 'n' ""favorite fruit"" salsa. Have your child choose a seasonal fruit. Finely chop it and stir ½ cup fruit with ¼ cup salsa. Serve with whole-grain corn tortilla chips — or grilled chicken strips.

Orange bowl. Scoop out segments from a large orange half. Cut a sliver off the rind on the bottom so it sits flat. Fill the orange bowl with whole-grain cereal and milk of choice. Place orange segments around it like they're sun rays.

Burger kebabs. Cook a veggie or turkey burger; cut into bite-size pieces; thread pieces onto bamboo skewers with cherry tomatoes and whole-grain pita triangles. Drizzle with ketchup or mustard.

Smoothie soup. Blend 1 cup frozen fruit of choice with ½ cup each vanilla yogurt and 100% fruit juice of choice. Serve as chilled soup in a bowl or cantaloupe ""bowl.""

Ant attack. Spread a mixture of ¼ cup low-fat cream cheese and 2 tablespoons salsa onto a whole-wheat tortilla. Top with shredded leafy greens and scallions (""grass"") and black beans (""ants"").

Packing Snacks Ahead of Time

If you need to pack snacks for your child to take to school, choose options that are still safe to eat at the end of the school day. Foods should not sit out unrefrigerated for more than two hours or for more than one hour when the temperature is 90 degrees Fahrenheit or above.

If you're sending kids to school with an after-school snack and a refrigerator isn't available, pack nourishing, shelf-stable foods such as:

Breads/grains. Single-serving boxes of whole-wheat cereal and trail mix, energy bars, granola bars, cereal bars, whole-wheat bagels and popcorn without added butter.

Fruits and vegetables. Carrot and celery sticks and other cut-up raw vegetables, grapes, cherry tomatoes, single-serve applesauce, washed whole fruit (apples, peaches, bananas), dried fruit mix and 100% juice boxes.

Teach your children to carefully wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before eating or handling food. Include a packet of moist towelettes in your child's lunch to serve as a friendly reminder to clean up before lunchtime.",planning

There's more to consider than packing a few extra snacks and baby wipes. Follow these tips for a healthy, happy and nourishing vacation with kids.

Road Trip

Logging a lot of miles in the car may have your kids asking for snacks to ease the boredom. Anticipate this, and be prepared. Work with your kids on a list of boredom-busting activities including games, music, videos, coloring books and more. Before starting the car, review the day's schedule. Explain when and where you'll eat and make a strong effort to stick to your normal eating schedule.

Pack some of these travel-friendly foods for children over the age of 4, as some may pose a choking risk for younger children. If your child is at risk for choking, enjoy your food at a rest stop so you can supervise while eating.

Keep perishable items in a cooler with ice to reduce your chances of foodborne illness when on vacation.

Applesauce

Dried and fresh fruit

Popcorn

Trail mix

Peanut butter sandwiches

Don't forget portable eating utensils and plenty of napkins and wipes.

Have your kids come up with fun meal ideas where they combine their favorite snack with another item you purchase at a restaurant. Kids can combine different lean proteins with whole grains, fruits and vegetables to build a balanced meal or snack that's part retail, part from home. In the end you will save money and eat healthier. Water, milk or a fortified milk alternative are good beverage choices, and even restaurant meals should include fruits and vegetables. If the restaurant doesn't offer good options, fill in with the supply in your cooler.

A Stay at the Beach

Whether you're hitting the beach for a day or staying for a week, the same guidelines apply. Try to stick as closely to your normal eating schedule as possible. Bring a cooler with some of the foods listed above and plenty of ice. Pack ample water and encourage frequent sipping. The hot sun can be dehydrating, and the cool ocean water and tons of fun can distract kids from drinking fluids.

Cruising Along

Food is present constantly on cruise ships — and in big, showy ways. Remind children that just because food is available doesn't mean the family needs to eat it. Be a role model to your kids and encourage them to eat mindfully when they are hungry.

Travel Abroad

If you are traveling far or to places with new types of cultures, work with your family on planning where to eat in advance of your trip. Most restaurants around the world provide nutrition information online so you can plan on choosing the nutritious items that you have researched. Being in a new culture also is a great time to get your family to try new foods.

Visiting Family or Friends

Whether you're traveling with others or staying in their homes, you may run into well-meaning food pushers. Give relatives and friends a kind heads-up to your expectations when it comes to offering food to your children.

Buying

Buy fish from reputable sources such as grocery stores and seafood markets.

Purchase fresh fish only if it is properly refrigerated (below 40°F) or displayed on a thick bed of frozen ice.

Check to see that flesh is shiny and firm, not separating from the bone, and the odor is fresh and mild, rather than overly ""fishy.""

Be aware of possible cross-contamination of cooked and raw seafood if displayed in the same case.

Make sure packaged seafood is well-packed and packages are tightly sealed and free of tears.

Avoid packages of frozen seafood containing ice crystals. This is a sign the seafood has previously thawed and been refrozen.

Pick up seafood toward the end of your shopping trip and ask to have it bagged separately from other groceries.

Storing

Refrigerate or freeze seafood immediately after purchasing by wrapping it in cellophane or placing in an air-tight containers.

Store fresh, pasteurized or smoked seafood products in a refrigerator set at or below 40°F. Use a refrigerator thermometer to check the temperature.

Store live clams, oysters, mussels, crabs, lobsters and crayfish in a refrigerator, in well-ventilated containers and cover with a damp cloth or paper towel. Place container in a second bowl filled with ice and store on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator.

Use fresh seafood within two days after purchase or wrap up tightly and freeze it.

Store frozen seafood in a freezer set at or below 0°F until ready to use. Keep it in the original moisture and vapor-proof packages.

Preparing

Keep raw and cooked seafood separate to avoid cross-contamination.

Use two separate cutting boards, one for raw seafood and the other for cooked seafood.

Thoroughly wash your hands, utensils, plates and cutting boards that have touched raw seafood.

Defrost frozen seafood in the refrigerator, under cold running water or in the microwave. Never defrost seafood on the counter.

Cooking

Cook fish to 145°F or until it is opaque and flakes easily with a fork.

If cooking live mussels, clams or oysters, discard any shells that do not open during cooking.

Pregnant individuals, older people, young children and people with weakened immune systems should avoid raw seafood such as:Sushi or sashimiRaw shellfish (oysters, clams, scallops, mussels or ceviche)Seafood ordered undercooked or ""rare"" such as tuna carpaccioRefrigerated smoked seafood, such as salmon, cod, trout, tuna or mackerel, these are usually labeled as ""novo-style,"" ""lox,"" ""kippered,"" ""smoked"" or ""jerky.""

Gathering around the table to eat as a family has all kinds of benefits. Family meals allow parents to be role models who create a supportive environment that promotes healthy eating.

Family meals don't just mean better nutrition. Children of families who regularly eat together also are more likely to have higher intakes of fruits and vegetables and have a healthy weight, and are less likely to have behavior problems. Plus, they're closer to their parents. No wonder family meals are on the upswing!

Try these easy-to-follow tips to make family meals happen more often in your home:

Keep it simple:Attempting to make a meal with 20 ingredients is a recipe for disaster. Instead, build a small collection of go-to recipes to help you get in and out of the kitchen in under 30 minutes.

Choose ingredients that multitask:Ingredients you can use for more than one meal can be a major time saver. Instead of making just three chicken breasts, consider making six. This way, you can use the extras in other dishes such as chicken salad or fajitas.

Say ""no"" to takeout:A quick trip to the drive-thru might seem like a speedy way to get dinner on the table, but when eaten frequently over time, it may lack important nutrients while providing too much sodium, saturated fat and added sugar. A simple meal made at home from lean protein, whole grains and fresh, frozen or canned vegetables is more likely to contain the nutrients your family needs.

Make it a habit:Make sure each family member knows that everyone is to be home for dinner at a particular time. When everyone expects to enjoy dinner at 5 p.m. on Sunday, they'll begin to look forward to this family time and will arrange their schedules around it.

It's OK to ask for help:You have a little army of helpers right at your fingertips. Asking kids to set the table, pour drinks or help make a salad doesn’t just make your job easier — it also teaches them that taking the time and effort to eat together as a family is important. Younger kids can practice counting skills by getting the correct number of forks and napkins for the table. Teens love the independence they have when shopping for groceries. Hand them some money and a grocery list and let them pick out an extra vegetable or some whole-grain bread for dinner.

Make it fun:Add some fun and excitement with food themes. Throw a blanket on your family room floor and enjoy a picnic. Let everyone choose a theme and you'll see that your choices are endless. Now that you're enjoying the meal, keep everyone involved in conversations by asking each person to share something that happened during the day or week that was funny, weird, scary, good or bad.

Start your new family meal tradition today by making a commitment to eating at least one meal together each week. Many families look forward to and love their Sunday dinner tradition. Before you know it, family dinner will be a time that everyone looks forward to!",planning

Avoid Under and Overcooking

Cooking meat to proper internal temperatures ensures the safety of your holiday meal as well as the taste. To make sure your holiday turkey, ham or other dishes are safe and delicious,use a food thermometer to check for doneness.

Watch the Clock

Many holiday meals are buffet or potluck-style. After you set your spread, be sure to set your timer. After two hours, harmful bacteria can multiply rapidly, putting you and your guests at risk of food poisoning. Keep your holiday smorgasbord safe by promptly refrigerating foods below 40°F within two hours. Or, consider keeping a fresh set of food in the fridge and swapping it out at the two-hour mark.

To Stuff or Not to Stuff

Many people cook stuffing inside their holiday turkey but some don't know the proper temperature to which it should be cooked. A whole turkey should reach a minimum internal temperature of 165°F. Check the temperature at the thickest part of the breast, innermost part of the thigh and innermost part of the wing with a thermometer to ensure it's been fully cooked.

Consider cooking the stuffing separately from the bird for uniform doneness and to reduce the risk of undercooked food. If you do choose to cook the turkey and stuffing together, make sure the stuffing also reaches 165°F.

Savoring Leftovers

Eating leftovers from a holiday meal is sometimes as traditional as the meal itself. Whether you reheat leftovers at home or pack a ""leftover lunch"" to take to work or school, follow steps to help keep food safe and delicious.

Always reheat leftover foods to an internal temperature of 165°F and make sure food is not left out of refrigeration for more than two hours. Pack perishable lunch foods in an insulated bag and add an ice pack to make sure foods stay properly chilled.

Festive Twist

A festive holiday drink may not be complete without a colorful garnish of lime or orange. But do you remember to wash fruit before adding it to your drink? Wash ready-to-eat fruits such as pears and plums and don't forget to wash fruits with skin such as limes, oranges and lemons as well.

30-second Smoothie: Blend low-fat milk, frozen strawberries and a banana for a quick smoothie to enjoy with a bran muffin.

Enjoy a plate of cheese, olives, bread and fig or apricot jam.

If Your Time is Tight in the Morning, Get Organized Ahead of Time.

Ready-Set-Go: The night before, make a breakfast plan as you clean up from dinner. Set the table and prepare your cooking utensils the night before.

Omelets or Frittatas: Prepare fresh vegetable omelets or frittatas ahead of time to reheat all week long.

Brown Bag Breakfast: Grab a banana, a bag of trail mix made with whole-grain cereal, shelled pistachios and a favorite dried fruit (try diced apricot, pineapple or mango).

If Your Picky Eater Needs Coaxing...

Instead of Doughnuts: Offer whole-grain toaster waffles or pancakes. Add other foods such as low-fat milk and fruit to ensure some extra nutrition.

Banana Dog: Spread a couple of tablespoons of peanut or almond butter on a whole-grain hot dog bun. Peel a banana, place inside the bun and eat it like a hot dog. Pair this with low-fat or fat-free milk.

Gobble, Gobble, Gobble Bacon: Switch to turkey bacon, which is much lower in fat than traditional bacon.

Toast with Peanut Butter: Use whole-grain toast to boost fiber and use peanut butter for a morning protein boost. Add a glass of low-fat milk or 100% orange juice.

Not So Sugary Cereals: Substitute low-sugar, whole-grain cereals and pair with fresh or frozen berries.

Fresh Fruit: bananas, kiwi, pears, apples, mangoes, melon, grapefruit or whatever is in season.

Savory Breakfast Foods: The best breakfast for kids is the breakfast they'll eat, and that doesn’t mean they need to be traditional American breakfast foods. If your child prefers savory to sweet, there are plenty of foods that can be encouraged, too.

If Your Little One Doesn't Eat Much In The Morning...

Spread It Out: Have your child eat a piece of fruit and drink a glass of low-fat milk before they leave the house. Then, when they get to school, they can have a small snack; such as an oatmeal muffin or a low-sugar breakfast bar.

School Breakfasts: Many schools serve a variety of nutritious breakfasts for kids. If this is available in your area, encourage your children to take advantage of these options.

Easy Does It: Put breakfast fixings in an easy-to-grab place. Put the cereal on a lower shelf in the pantry so younger kids can reach it easily, and place fruit in a bowl on the counter where kids (and parents) can easily grab something nutritious on their way out the door.

Role Model It: If your child sees you making time to eat a healthy meal, they’ll be more likely to follow your healthy example.

With these easy and family-friendly healthy breakfast tips, you can help your family rise, shine and get ready for a busy day.",planning
Washing Leafy Greens,https://www.eatright.org/food/home-food-safety/wash-and-separate-foods/washing-leafy-greens,"Contributors:Jackie Newgent, RDN, CDNPublished:August 28, 2020Reviewed:August 31, 2020

Reviewed:August 31, 2020","From arugula to watercress, leafy greens are fresh, beautiful, tasty and healthful. They're popular, too. Over the past several decades, salads have gone from simple bowls of iceberg lettuce to glorious culinary spectacles in the center of the plate. Greens such as spinach and kale once were primarily served steamed or sautéed as sides, but are now found in cooked and raw preparations, from smoothies to desserts. There's one golden rule that applies to any leafy greens: Between purchasing and plating, washing them properly is key!

Leafy greens need to be handled safely just like any other food. And somefoodborne  illnesseshave been related to fresh leafy greens. Rinsing produce helps to remove some of the dirt and germs that may be present. This step and cooking are considered safer alternatives for vegetables that pose a higher risk of foodborne illness.Proper refrigerationis another important step. Perishable foods, including pre-washed or pre-cut produce, as well as cooked fruits and vegetables, should be refrigerated within 2 hours or within 1 hour, if the temperature is 90° Fahrenheit or above. Food safety for those at greater risk for food poisoning may include additional precautions.

Top Tips for Washing Leafy Greens

The first step in preparation of fresh greens, whether produced organically or conventionally, purchased from a farmers market or supermarket, served cooked or raw, is to wash them properly. Here's how:

Always start with clean hands. Wash your hands for 20 seconds or more with soap and warm water.

Cut away any damaged areas on leaves or stems before preparing or eating the greens. If something seems rotten, discard it. Avoid cross-contamination by using a clean knife to chop or shred the leafy greens after they have been washed and dried.

If leafy greensare notlabeled as ""pre-washed"" or ""ready-to-eat,"" thoroughly wash them under running waterjust beforechopping, cooking or eating. This will help reduce the presence of microorganisms.Hint: If you wash leafy greens before storing, you can potentially promote bacterial growth and enhance spoilage.

If lettuce has a core, such as iceberg lettuce, remove it before washing.

When you have loose leaves, such as mesclun, that can't easily be held under cold running water, use a colander or a salad spinner. Toss them around under the running water and repeat. Using a sink filled with water to wash produce is never recommended.

Never wash leafy greens with soap, detergent or bleach, since these can leave residues that are not meant to be consumed. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't recommend using commercial produce washes because these also may leave residues.

If leafy greensarelabeled as ""pre-washed"" or ""ready-to-eat,"" washing them is not necessary.

After washing fresh greens, pat them dry with paper towels or a freshly clean kitchen towel — or use a salad spinner — to help remove excess liquid.",home-food-safety

Spinach

One cup of cooked spinach is packed with vitamins A and K, which are essential for eye and bone health. This amount of spinach also delivers a high amount of folate and iron, which help prevent certain types of anemia. And its magnesium and potassium are important for muscle development and growth, while vitamin C helps support immune function.

If your kids are on board with green stuff, serve spinach salads or try it sautéed with meat, fish and tofu. For kids who don't like veggies, the mild flavor of spinach is easily masked. Just purée and mix it into sauces, smoothies, soups and meatballs. Your family will love this recipe forCreamy Parmesan Spinach Squares!

Beets

A cup of beets is an excellent source of folate and a good source of dietary fiber. Did you know beet greens also are edible? A one-cup serving of cooked beet greens is an excellent source of vitamins A and K, potassium and magnesium.

Challenge the stereotype of beets being one of the most-hated vegetables by preparing these nutritious roots in tasty ways. Roast beets and serve hot or cold for a touch of sweetness and a pop of color. Blend cooked beets intosoupsand sauces or shred raw beets as a crunchy topping for salads, tacos and more. Make a beautiful dip your kids will love bypuréeing cooked beets into hummus!

Strawberries

Another seasonal superstar is fresh strawberries. Just 1 cup of sliced strawberries provides a day's worth ofvitamin C, plus a hearty dose of manganese, which is important for bone development. A cup of strawberries also packs 3 grams of dietary fiber.

Try them alone, in a fruit salad, in a green salad, over cereal,with yogurtor even blend frozen strawberries into a smoothie for a thicker consistency. And don't toss those strawberry tops that you washed and cut off! Add them to still or sparkling water for a refreshing, fruity infused beverage.

Asparagus

One cup of cooked asparagus is an excellent source of bone-building vitamin K, as well as folate. It also provides vitamin A and iron. Available in green, purple and white varieties, asparagus spears are fun to eat and pair with all kinds of foods.

Asparagus is super tasty whenroasted with a little olive oil, salt and pepper. Serve as a side with dinner or cut into pieces to add to pasta, stir-fries, salads and more.

Remember to include kids in grocery shopping and food preparation. This helps them learn about different foods and age-appropriate cooking tasks, which makes it more likely they will enjoy a variety of foods.",food-preparation

But for the millions of Americans with food allergies and sensitivities, avoiding contact with an offending food is as much of a concern. Contact with even a small amount of a specific food may cause life threatening reactions in people with food allergies or cause damage to the intestinal tract of those with celiac disease.

Many of us know someone with celiac disease or a food allergy or sensitivity, so knowing how to keep foods safe when cooking at home is important.You've probably heard the terms ""cross-contamination"" and ""cross-contact."" While used interchangeably, they are different.

Cross-contaminationis when harmful bacteria are transferred to a food from another food or surface. Most dangerous bacteria can be reduced by cooking foods to the proper internal temperature.

Cross-contactis when the food allergen or gluten is transferred to a food meant to be allergen- or gluten-free. Cooking does not prevent having a reaction for a person with an allergy or sensitivity to the ingredient.

Safety Starts at the Store

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration'sFood Allergen and Labeling Consumer Protection ActandGluten-Free Food Labeling Rulehave made shopping much easier, but care and attention are still required when selecting items from store shelves:

When shopping for others, store problematic foods in plastic produce bags and consider placing them in a second cart. Keep them separate through checkout, and until you store them at home.

Avoid foods from bulk bins, hot/cold salad bars and the deli counter, as these are common sites for cross-contact.

Read ingredient labels each and every time you shop, as recipes can change without warning.

Set Up a Storage System

If you can't keep the entire house free from an offending food, try the following:

Choose squeeze bottles, when possible, to eliminate cross-contact from “double-dipping” utensils into condiments like peanut butter, jelly or sour cream.

Try to use condiments that are safe for everyone in the family to enjoy, but if this is not possible, clearly label the option that is gluten- or allergen-free.

Dedicate shelves or cupboards to allergen and/or gluten-free foods to avoid confusion.

Place gluten- and allergen-containing foods on shelves below allergen- or gluten-free foods — in the pantry, refrigerator and freezer.

Conscious Cooking is Key to Preventing Cross-Contact

Depending on the food that needs to be avoided and where practical, consider using separate sets of utensils and small appliances such as toasters, pots, strainers, cutting boards, rolling pins, whisks and pizza cutters.

Prepare and cook allergen- or gluten-free dishes before making items that contain those ingredients. Be sure to use cleaned equipment and surfaces.

If possible, dedicate a kitchen space to allergen- or gluten-free food preparation.

Wash and Wash Again

Wash and sterilize everything food being prepared may touch.

Wash hands with clean, soapy water for 20 seconds.

Change gloves and aprons when working with allergens.

Wash plates, small equipment and utensils with hot, soapy water or rinse off residue and put it in the dishwasher.

To clean surfaces and larger appliances, use a dry towel to wipe off crumbs first, then wash or sterilize.

Consider Cross-Contact Through Service

Serve guests who need allergen- or gluten-free foods first and carry their dishes separately from others.

For family-style meals, allow guests with allergies or intolerances to serve themselves first.

Avoid ""make-your-own"" dishes with high risk for cross-contact, including sundaes, salads and topping bars.

If, after taking all these precautions, you think cross-contact has occurred, let your guest know. They will happily wait to be served a dish that is safe to eat.",home-food-safety

Reviewed:March 19, 2019","Tangor, ugli, jostaberry and pluot… these are just a few curiously named hybrid fruits found at the grocery store or farmers market. With bizarre names, hybrids might sound like weird science, but these fruits and their many cousins are more natural and familiar than you might think.

Hybrids don't use genetically modified organism technology. Hybrids use traditional pollination that can ordinarily occur in nature. With controlled pollination, cultivars can breed new generations of fruiting plants with increasingly desirable characteristics.

Farmers benefit from hybridized fruit plants that are naturally disease resistant and hearty in heat, cold and drought — in addition to producing consistent, higher yields with predictable fruit maturation times. As a result, consumers benefit from unique, uniform fruit sizes and shapes, increased juiciness, improved taste and better nutrition.

Here are 10 hybrid fruits to add to your shopping list.

Tangor:A cross between a mandarin and an orange — the tangor may sound unfamiliar, but varieties such as murcott and temple have been hitting the produce department of local grocery stores.

Ugli:BotanicallyCitrus reticulata x paradisi, the ""ugly"" hybrid of a grapefruit, orange and tangerine, this tangelo from Jamaica reflects more sweet flavors from its tangerine ancestry rather than bitter grapefruit. Add uglis, halved or sectioned, to a salad with avocado, sweet onion, chicory and radicchio.

Jostaberry:Sweeter than its North American and European gooseberry and black currant parents, the jostaberry is a rich, almost black berry with grape, blueberry and kiwi flavors and packed with vitamin C.

Pluot:A Zaiger trademarked plum and apricot hybrid, it's bred for smooth skin and super juicy, sweet flesh.

Baby Kiwi:The lineage of the baby kiwi traces back to fuzzy kiwifruit, also known as the Chinese gooseberry. With smooth skin that doesn't need to be peeled, the typically berry-sized baby kiwi can vary in size, shape, color and taste between producers.

Tayberry:A cross between a red raspberry and blackberry, the tayberry looks like an elongated raspberry with tart flavor.

Limequat:This ripe key lime and kumquat hybrid resembles a miniature oval orange with greenish-yellow skin. In season from mid-fall to winter, limequats — with their tart key lime flavor— can be eaten whole, in jams or accompanying fish or chicken.

Pineberry:A novel cross between white strawberries from Southern Europe and cultivated red strawberries produce this pineapple-flavored berry, typically available early May through June.

Orangelo:This hybrid, believed to be of Puerto Rican origin, is a cross between a grapefruit and an orange, and is sweeter and more vivid than its grapefruit parent, however, eaten in much the same way.",food-groups

While there are countless slaw variations, two traditional coleslaw ingredients are cabbage and carrots — both of which boast healthy nutrition profiles.

One cup of raw, shredded cabbage offers around 20 calories and provides 2 grams of dietary fiber. It is an excellent source of vitamin C and provides phytonutrients lutein and zeaxanthin, which areimportant nutrients for eye health. Carrots also are low in calories and packed with nutritional benefits: ½ cup of grated carrot has 23 calories, provides 1.5 grams of fiber, is an excellent source of vitamin A, and also contains lutein and zeaxanthin.

You can further boost the nutrition profile of your slaw by incorporating other ingredients. Cut thin ribbons of broccoli, bok choy, Swiss chard, kale, beets, green papaya, apples, jicama or mango. Use a traditional mayonnaise dressing with fresh herbs, or change it up with a light rice vinaigrette or sesame-soy tahini combination. Add even more dietary fiber and a dose of protein with chickpeas, lentils or cubed tofu.

Need some slaw inspiration? Here are some variations certain to please any palate.

Sweet-but-tart slaws:Made with sweet dressings and flavorful vinegars, these slaws often include sweet fruits such as pineapple, apple or raisins. Dried cranberries, toasted almonds or thinly sliced fennel are other flavor enhancers.

Creamy slaws:These mayonnaise-based slaws can be deliciously spicy when made with mustards and horseradish. Substitute mayonnaise with plain Greek yogurt and add broccoli, broccolini, chilies or red pepper flakes for more crunch and heat.

Asian-inspired slaws:With no creamy ingredients and fewer added sugars than traditional coleslaw, they're commonly made with ingredients such as ginger, peanut butter, lime juice, soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, sesame seeds, green onions, dry noodles and peanuts.

Cabbage-free slaws:These variations are considered slaws because of the way the vegetables, fruits or other ingredients are finely chopped and tossed together.

Sweet peppers, radicchio and squashes make for a colorful slaw as well. So be creative the next time you are browsing your grocery produce section. Your slaw recipe could be a big hit at the next family meal.",food-preparation

As with any part of raising children, no one does a perfect job with nutrition. As a parent, grandparent or adult caregiver, you can help to raise healthy eaters during these critical years by doing your best to:

Serve regular, balanced meals and snacks with a variety of nutrient-rich foods.

Provide calm, pleasant mealtimes where adults and children can talk together.

Remove distractions such as television, phones and tablets so that your attention is on each other.

Allow children to use their internal signals to decide how much and what to eat from the foods you set out for each meal.

Explore a variety of flavors and foods from different cultures and cuisines.

Share an appreciation for healthful food, lovingly prepared and shared with others.

Make food safety, such as washing hands, part of every eating occasion.

Teach basic skills for making positive food choices away from home.

Find credible food and nutrition resources when you don't know the answer.

While this may seem like an intimidating to-do list, two family habits go a long way to making all this happen: regular family meals and involving kids in nutrition from the ground up.

Make Family Mealtimes a Priority

Sometimes a simple act can have important, long-lasting benefits. According to parenting and health experts, that’s the case with family meals. For example, eating and talking together can help:

Foster family unity

Prevent behavior problems at home and school

Enhance academic success

Improve nutrition

Promote healthy weight for kids

With that impressive list of benefits, it's worth making the time and effort to enjoy more meals together each week. Look for easy ways to add just one family meal to the schedule. If evenings seem too hectic for family dinners, set aside time for a weekend breakfast or lunch. After a month or two of this new pattern, try adding another family meal each week. Before you know it, you will be eating together on most days.

Get Kids Involved in Nutrition

Start young and make nutrition fun. There's an opportunity for kids to learn about nutrition in a variety of places — your kitchen, the grocery store or a community garden. Every trip through the supermarket can be a nutrition lesson. Kids can learn to categorize food into groups: grains, fruits, vegetables, dairy and protein foods. They can choose new foods they want to try, including picking out a new fresh, frozen, canned or dried fruit each trip. As children get older, they can help plan the menu at home and then pick out the foods to match the menu items while shopping.

Nutrition is just one of many reasons to have a garden. The process of planting, watching over and harvesting a garden provides daily opportunities for children to learn valuable lessons and enjoy physical activity, while reaping the fruits (and vegetables) of their labor.",food-preparation

The process of freezing prevents the growth of bacteria, yeasts and molds that cause food spoilage and food poisoning. However, freezing does not destroy them, so it is important to follow these tips to safely freeze and protect the quality of your foods.

Proper Storage, Temperature and Time

Keep your freezer at or below 0°F to keep your food safe. Only the quality may suffer with lengthy freezer storage. Built-in temperature control dials may not be accurate, so use a separate appliance thermometer to check the internal freezer temperature. These thermometers are available in grocery, hardware and kitchen specialty stores. Because the process of freezing keeps food safe almost indefinitely, recommended storage times are meant for quality control.

What Can You Freeze?

You can freeze almost any food with some exceptions, including unopened canned foods or eggs in shells. You can safely freeze items such as mayonnaise, cream sauce and lettuce, but the quality will suffer. Meat, poultry, seafood and other vegetables are great foods to freeze because they are perishable, so freezing helps to maintain their safety and quality.

Packaging for the Freezer

Food items should be tightly packed in freezer bags or airtight containers. Squeeze air from bags before sealing and leave some space in containers in case foods expand. If moisture escapes, frozen food can become dry, tough and may develop ""freezer burn.""

To prevent moisture loss, use packaging designed for freezing including:

""Can or freeze"" glass jars

Plastic freezing containers

Heavyweight aluminum foil

Plastic-coated freezer paper

Polyethylene wrap and bags

Freezer-safe bags

Do not use cardboard cartons or reuse plastic containers from cottage cheese, ice cream, whipped topping or other foods as these containers were not designed to safely freeze foods. And remember to always label and date foods before placing in the freezer.

Preventing Freezer Burn

""Freezer burn"" refers to the white, dried-out patches that appear on the surface of frozen foods. Although freezer burn won't make you sick, it makes frozen foods — such as meat and produce — tough and tasteless. Foods with freezer burn can still be eaten — simply cut away the sections of freezer burn before or after cooking.

Here are some tips on how to prevent freezer burn:

Before freezing, wrap items in heavy freezer paper, plastic wrap, freezer bags or foil.

Date all freezer packages and use the oldest food first.

Make older items easier to access by placing them in the front of the freezer.",home-food-safety

England

Mincemeat pies, or mince pies, have been served since the Middle Ages. However, today’s version looks very different from those eaten 600 years ago. During the Middle Ages, the pies were primarily a mixture of minced game meat, lamb or beef with dried fruits and spices. While meat is typically left out of the mix these days, some recipes containsuet, a type of animal fat.

Ethiopia

While many Christian faiths and governments observe Christmas Day on December 25, Orthodox faiths follow a different calendar. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church observes Christmas on January 7.

Prior to Christmas, followers observe a 40-day vegan fast, refraining from all animal-based foods. On Christmas, a popular food to break this fast with isdoro wat, a type of stew made with a rich red sauce and served with the spongy flatbreadinjera. Rooster is a popular protein choice indoro waton this special day.

France

Seafood, particularly oysters, are not an uncommon choice for Christmas Eve in France. Some popular ways to eat them are grilled or on the half shell.

The well-known yule log, orBûche de Noël, is a sponge cake baked into one thin layer, spread with a filling such as frosting or whipped cream, then carefully rolled into a log and decorated. Design elements might include meringue mushrooms or fresh herbs.

Other popular foods include fresh and dried fruits andfougasse, an olive oil flatbread.

India

In the western state of Goa, popular foods eaten at Christmastime may includebebinca, a type of layer cake made of coconut milk pancakes, andsorpotel, a popular pork curry made with cumin, chiles and cinnamon that is served on Christmas Eve.

Italy

Geography plays a role in regional food choices, with fish being popular in the southern part of the country with dishes such asbaccalà, a pan-fried salt cod. Italian-American culture has been influenced by this fish-eating tradition, with theFesta Dei Sette Pesci, or Feast of the Seven Fishes, celebrated on Christmas Eve.

Panettoneandpandoroare popular sweets eaten during the Christmas season.Panettoneis a dome-shaped cake similar to brioche in texture but filled with candied fruit and raisins. It’s not uncommon to buy it rather than make it at home, as it takes at least 30 hours for the dough to rise.Pandorois baked in an eight-point star-shaped pan, said to be modeled after the mountains in Verona, and may have fillings like lemon or chocolate cream or be plain and dusted with powdered sugar.

Mexico

Tamales are a favorite for those celebrating Christmas in Mexico, as well as several other countries in Central and South America. Tamales consist of a masa harina dough and are stuffed with a variety of fillings, including cheese, beans, vegetables or meat. They’re wrapped in a corn husk and steamed before eating. The entire process can take hours, and it’s not uncommon for family members to work together to assemble tamales.

Other popular Christmas dishes include turkey in mole sauce andpozole— a type of broth-based soup that may be topped with garnishes such as lime, radish and lettuce. Similar to the Italian tradition,bacalao(dried salt cod) is another dish you may find in homes or at market stands, served in either a tomato sauce or as a sandwich.

Select 100% fruit juices — they don’t contain added sugars. Choose reduced-sodium versions of vegetable juices.

Grain-Based Foods

Choose mostly whole-grain versions of foods like bread, cereal, rice and pasta. Examples are 100% whole-wheat bread, oatmeal, shredded wheat, brown rice and whole-wheat spaghetti.

Enjoy “ancient grains” like quinoa, amaranth, bulgur and millet. These examples are whole grains, too!

Tip: Save time with quick-cooking grains like quinoa or rice.

Dairy and Plant-Based Alternatives

Select low-fat and fat-free versions of milk, yogurt and cheese or look for calcium-fortified soy milk,

Soy milk contains a similar amount of protein, whereas other plant-based beverages can vary in their protein, vitamin and mineral content, so carefully compare labels.

Compare added sugar levels in yogurt products and choose those with lower amounts of added sugars most often.

Shelf-stable or powdered milk are other options.

Protein Foods

Opt for lean meats — look for cuts with “loin” or “round” in the name to minimize saturated fat.

Buy skinless poultry or remove the skin before or after cooking.

Choose fatty fish such salmon, Atlantic or Pacific mackerel, tuna and sardines for their heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids. Find them fresh, frozen, canned or in pouches.

Try plant-based proteins like nuts and seeds, peanut butter, almond butter, beans (kidney, black, pinto, garbanzo and more), peas and lentils.

Buy economical bags of dry beans to make from scratch. For convenience, stock up on reduced-sodium canned beans, or rinse regular beans under cold water to reduce sodium.

Experiment with soy proteins like edamame (green soybeans), tofu (soybean cake) and tempeh (fermented soybean cake that may also contain grains).

Oils and Spreads

For cooking and baking, choose a liquid vegetable oil such as olive, canola, corn, safflower, soybean or sunflower oil. Oils contain less saturated fat than solid fats like butter and lard.

For spreads, buy soft tub, liquid or spray margarine for less saturated fat than butter or stick margarine. Look for products with no trans fat by checking the Nutrition Facts Label and in the ingredients for words like “partially hydrogenated.”

Strategic Shopping Tips

Staying organized is key to grocery shopping. Use these tips:

Create a go-to list of frequently purchased items. That way, you can quickly check off what you need on your next shopping trip.

Don’t overbuy. Check your fridge, freezer and pantry for items already on hand.

Make a shopping list. Put it on paper or use a meal-planning app on your smartphone that generates a shopping list based on your chosen recipes and other items you add. Many supermarkets offer apps that let you make lists and clip electronic coupons.

Be efficient at the store. Organize your list according to your store’s layout to avoid backtracking. Stick with the items on your list to avoid costly “impulse” purchases. Shop at less busy times, usually early in the morning or later in the evening.

Shop smart online. Review your past orders (usually available in your account information) to jog your memory for items you may need. Stick to your list and resist the impulse to add unneeded items to your online cart.

When your pantry is well stocked, a nutritious and tasty meal or snack is just minutes away. Get suggestions for what to stock and learn about 10 popular pantry staples below.

The Scoop on 10 Popular Pantry Staples

Oats.Oats provide iron and B vitamins and contain soluble fiber, which may help lower blood cholesterol. Oatmeal makes a satisfying breakfast, but also enjoy oats in smoothies, cookies, pancakes, and homemade granola and snack bars.

Whole-grain ready-to-eat cereals.Choose a cereal that lists a whole grain as the first ingredient. Compare the Nutrition Facts Label on different brands to find options with at least 3 grams of dietary fiber and the fewest grams of added sugars per serving. Enjoy whole-grain cereal for a quick breakfast or snack or add to homemade trail mix.

Whole grains.Nutty-tasting brown rice is a whole-grain food that offers dietary fiber, protein and B vitamins. Use it as a side dish and in salads, soups and stuffing. Use other whole grains, such as quinoa, millet and amaranth, in most recipes that call for rice.

Whole-grain pasta.Look for options made from whole wheat, brown rice, quinoa or other whole grains. Whole-grain pasta is usually higher in dietary fiber and protein than enriched pasta. Stock a variety of shapes to use as an entrée with your favorite sauce, or as an ingredient in soups, casseroles and cold salads.

Beans and lentils.Dried and canned beans and lentils provide dietary fiber, protein and B vitamins. Stock a variety such as black, pinto, kidney and white beans, and brown, green and red lentils. Add them to salads, soups, chili, salsa, casseroles and pasta.

Tuna, salmon and sardines(cans or pouches). Packed with protein and heart-healthy omega-3 fats, use tuna, salmon and sardines in salads, sandwich fillings and casseroles, or for a snack on crackers.

Canned tomatoes.Tasty canned tomatoes add vitamin C and the antioxidant lycopene to a variety of dishes. Use whole or crushed tomatoes for sauces and soups. Choose diced tomatoes for bruschetta, salsa or guacamole.

Stocks and broths(unsalted or low sodium). Stocks and broths add flavor to soups, stir-fries, sauces, stuffing, rice, pasta and more.

Mustard.Mustard, such as Dijon or spicy brown mustard, adds creaminess and zesty flavor to salad dressings, sauces, marinades and dips. It’s also great in chicken, beef, pork and seafood dishes.

Cooking oils.Keep a variety of oils for different purposes. For instance, use a fruity olive oil in salad dressings and neutral-flavored canola oil in baked goods. Drizzle toasted sesame oil onto stir-fried vegetables.

10 Surprising Foods You Should Be Refrigerating,https://www.eatright.org/food/home-food-safety/safe-food-storage/10-surprising-foods-you-should-be-refrigerating,"Contributors:Karen Ansel, MS, RDN, CDN

Reviewed:January 20, 2020","You may already know milk, meat and eggs belong in the fridge. But what about less obvious foods? Storing these 10 foods in the fridge will help to keep them safe and taste great longer.

1. Tortillas

Some tortillas are prone to molding. That's why the fine print on many tortilla packages recommends refrigerating after opening. Chill tortillas to help them stay fresh. The date on their package is for quality purposes, so when foods are stored properly they may be consumed beyond their date, if there are no signs of spoilage.

2. Salami

Cured meats including salami are less likely to harbor bacteria than cooked meats, but that doesn't mean they're always 100% safe. Refrigeration can slow potential bacterial growth, but people who are at higher risk of foodborne illness, such as pregnant women, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems should reheat ready-to-eat foods like lunch and deli meats. Store unopened salami in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.  After opening, it should be consumed within three to five days.

3. Ripe Bananas

It's fine to ripen bananas on the kitchen counter. Trouble is, they keep ripening, and ripening and ripening. Once they're ready to eat, pop them in the fridge for up to three days. Their skins may turn brown, but they're still fine to eat.

4. Nuts

Nuts' fragile unsaturated fats can go rancid quickly. While that may not hurt your health, it can definitely be bad news for flavor. Keep nuts tasting fresh by stowing them in a sealed plastic or glass container in the refrigerator for four to six months.

5. Maple Syrup

Maple syrup has a surprisingly short shelf life. So if yours is sitting in your pantry, it's time to relocate it to the fridge. Stored in the refrigerator, maple syrup usually can stay fresh for up to a year. However, if you notice any mold growth, be sure to toss it immediately.

6. Dried Fruit

Dried fruit has less moisture than fresh fruit, so it doesn't spoil as quickly, but refrigeration can help it maintain its freshness longer. Keep it in the main compartment of your refrigerator for up to six months.

7. Ketchup

Restaurants may leave their ketchup on the table, but that doesn't mean you should. While its high acid content will keep most bacteria at bay, cool temperatures help maintain flavor and freshness. Refrigerate ketchup for up to six months.

8. Corn on the Cob

After picking, corn begins to lose its sugar content dramatically when left at room temperature. Unless you're going to cook it right away, keep corn in the fridge — husks and all — for one to two days.

9. Chocolate Syrup

Chocolate syrup is an easy way to make a glass of milk taste even better. But not if it has developed funny flavors. Chill yours after opening and you can enjoy it for six months.

10. Pecan and Pumpkin Pies

Made with eggs, these treats are magnets for bacteria. Fresh from the oven, they're okay to eat at room temperature for up to two hours and only one hour if it is over 90 degrees Fahrenheit. After that, they should go straight into the fridge and eaten within three to four days or frozen for another time.

People who eat more home-cooked meals not only tend to consume more fruits, vegetables and dietary fiber, but also eat less saturated fat and salt. Homemade food also can be budget-friendly and reduces use of takeout containers.

But where do you start? Here are eight tips to develop basic cooking skills, especially if you have a small kitchen, limited utensils and appliances or a tight budget.

Get a cookbook.

While there areexcellent recipesonline, food-covered fingers and electronic devices don’t mix. Cookbooks often have photos of the cooking process and finished product, plus they don’t require tapping or scrolling to keep a screen from going dark. Always read through a recipe several times and consider writing notes in the margins of books you own. For example, note if ingredients must be chopped before beginning. A cookbook written by a registered dietitian nutritionist often contains healthful and delicious recipes with easy preparation techniques.

Plan to reduce wasted food.

Cooking involves prepping ingredients such as produce. Skip the somewhat daunting step of chopping by buying frozen or canned vegetables and fruits. Frozen, canned and dried foods may helpreduce wastebecause they have a longer shelf life. Plus, the steel cans used for canned foods are 100% recyclable. If you choose to use fresh produce, save the scraps for a flavorful stock or soup recipe.

Boil dried beans and grains.

You can make any number of grain or bean-based meals for a relatively low cost. Bring your own containers to the supermarket and shop the bulk bins to avoid extra packaging. Try cooking these grains: oats, farro, millet, teff, barley, quinoa, buckwheat, bulgur or wheat berries. There are best practices for cooking differentbean varietiesand whole grains, but consider trying this easy method (note: especially for beans or grains that require longer cooking times, frequently check the water level to ensure the pot doesn’t cook dry and burn):

To a pot, add 1 cup of lentils, whole grains or soaked, drained and rinsed dried beans.

Cover with 2 to 3 cups water and ¼ teaspoon salt.

Bring to a boil, cover, then reduce heat to simmer.

Cook lentils 20 to 40 minutes (unless split, which cook in only 5 to 10 minutes); cook brown rice 40 to 45 minutes; or cook beans 1 to 2 hours, or until tender.

Perfect pasta.

It’s easy to overcook and waterlog pasta if you wait for the water to come to a boil before setting the timer. Refer to the directions on the package and follow these steps:

Bring a pot of water to boil (10 to 12 cups of water for 8 ounces of dry pasta).

Add 1½ teaspoons salt, if desired, but never add oil as it makes pasta too slippery for sauce to stick. Then, add dry pasta and immediately set a timer for the time specified on the package (fettuccine generally cooks in 12 to 13 minutes, but spaghetti takes only 9 to 10 minutes).

Boil pasta, uncovered, stirring occasionally.

When timer count is up, immediately drain pasta. Only rinse pasta if it’s being used in a cold pasta salad.

Roast vegetables and meat.

One energy-saving tip for roasting meat and vegetables is to preheat the oven with a rimmed sheet pan already inside. This shortens the cooking time and gives your food a head start on browning. Be careful when removing the hot pan from the oven and adding oil-tossed vegetables. Always use afood thermometerto check the safe internal temperatures for meat and other foods.

Master microwaving.

Most people would benefit from eating more fish, but cooking it can be intimidating. For great results and to prevent overcooking, cook fish in themicrowave.

Place 1 to 4thawed, previously frozen fish fillets in a glass bowl or pie plate, sprinkle with salt, and drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 to 4 tablespoons lemon, lime or orange juice.

Cover with a microwave-safe plate.

Microwave on high for 2 minutes, check for doneness to ensure it reaches a minimum internal temperature of 145°  Fahrenheit. If more cooking is needed, microwave in 20-second intervals until fish is opaque and flakes apart easily.

Experiment with eggs.

Even with rising food prices,eggsare still one of the cheapest sources of high-quality protein and nutrients, such as choline, lutein and zeaxanthin. Hard-boiled eggs are ideal for grab-and-go breakfasts or protein-packed snacks at any time of day. Learn basic preparation techniques from a cookbook or search for recipes that feature hard-boiled, microwaved, scrambled and fried eggs.

Slow cook like a pro.

While this list ofbasic cooking toolshelps stock an efficient kitchen, a slow cooker is especially helpful if you’re cooking for a family or have limited time to make dinner for yourself. Buy a new slow cooker or an inexpensive, pre-owned one at a thrift shop or online — many come with a recipe book. Everything from perfectly cooked rice to simple salsa chicken and other budget-friendly recipes are within reach with this energy-saving appliance.",food-preparation
Dive into Aquaculture: A Sustainable Seafood System,https://www.eatright.org/food/planning/food-security-and-sustainability/aquaculture-a-sustainable-seafood-system,"Contributors:Ginger Hultin, MS, RDN, CSOPublished:November 20, 2023
Published:November 20, 2023","Some agricultural production systems rely on soil to farm plants for food. There’s also farming that involves raising land animals for food. But have you heard of aquaculture? Although it is sometimes referred to as “farmed fish,” aquaculture is more complex and involves both underwater plants and animals.

Aquaculture: The Basics

Farming in water includes environments such as oceans, rivers and even pens or tanks submerged in the water or on land, which is called inland or freshwater aquaculture. As of June 2023, there are approximately 600 species being farmed in countries around the world — significant for helping to feed the global population. Aquatic plants such as edible seaweeds or algae are being grown along with a variety of aquatic animals including:

Fish (salmon, black sea bass, sablefish, yellowtail, pompano, trout, catfish)

Shellfish (oysters, clams, mussels, shrimp, crawfish)

Reptiles (crocodiles, alligators, turtles)

Amphibians (frogs)

Aquaculture is becoming increasingly complex, with a focus on plant and animal health and production practices. There also are other forms of farming in the water: hydroponics and aquaponics.Hydroponicsis the process of farming or gardening plants in a water-based solution, rather than in soil, either on land or in water such as a lake, river or ocean.Aquaponicsis the process of growing fish and plants together in the water without soil. The nutrients for the plants come from beneficial bacteria that convert fish waste into fertilizer. The plants help keep the tanks or containers clean, so it is considered a sustainable practice.

Farmed Fish vs. Aquaculture

Aquaculture is a farming practice that does encompass “farming” fish. However, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, also known as the NOAA Fisheries, farm-raised fish and shellfish grown in the United States are held to rigorous standards to ensure safety. Since most seafood consumed in the U.S. is imported from other countries, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has established several processes to oversee its safety.

How Aquaculture Contributes to Sustainability

Aquaculture plays an increasingly vital role in the sustainability of food that grows both in the oceans and in freshwater. It can be used to increase accessibility and affordability of seafood for consumers and support guidance such as the 2020-2025Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which encourages the consumption of seafood for health.

Aquaculture also plays a role in supporting wild seafood. When fish and shellfish are farmed, it helps to sustain fisheries that harvest wild-caught seafood. Aquaculture also can be used to protect wild seafood habitats and revitalize or support the environment, as well as the health of threatened or endangered species of fish or shellfish.

According to the FDA, about 90% of seafood eaten in the United States is imported — and more than half of it is produced through aquaculture practices. The FDA, along with other agencies, holds seafood grown through aquaculture to the same standards as fresh or wild seafood. Aquatic animal health in the United States is monitored through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which works with the World Organization for Animal Health to ensure standards are maintained in the health and safety of aquatic animals and their international trade. As the world’s population grows and demands more seafood, it’s important for farming in water to be sustainable, safe and effective.",planning
Kids in the Garden: A Nutritious and Fun Experience,https://www.eatright.org/food/planning/food-security-and-sustainability/kids-in-the-garden-nutritious-and-fun,"Contributors:Marisa Moore, MBA, RDN, LD

Reviewed:April 22, 2024","An expanding body of research shows that when kids help grow fruits and vegetables, they are more likely to eat more produce and try different kinds, too.

The benefits of gardening don't end there. Gardening helps kids engage their curiosity, learn to be resourceful and gain self-confidence. It also is a great way to get the entire family outside for fresh air and physical activity.

Get started with these tips on easy foods to grow in the garden.

Make Kids Part of the Planting and Growing Process

Depending on their age, children take to gardening differently. For example, preschoolers tend to be fascinated with exploring dirt, digging holes, planting seeds and working the garden hose, while older children may be more interested in how a single seed turns into an edible plant. Older kids can read seed packets and start to understand growing regions, while younger kids may not understand that it's probably not possible to grow oranges in northern Maine. Suggest fun, reliable plants such as purple carrots and striped beets, and make sure you plant a couple of sure bets for your region. Ask children which fruits and vegetables they would like to grow. Teach children responsibility by assigning each child a watering, harvesting or weeding task. Allowing children to be involved in every step of the process will get them excited to taste the fruits (and vegetables) of their labor.

Encourage Taste Testing

Gardening exposes kids to a variety of fruits and vegetables, so encourage taste testing straight from the ground (after a quick rinse to remove dirt) and at the dinner table. Show kids how a tomato can taste delicious from the vine or in dishes such as fresh salsa, marinara sauce or tomato soup to bring the experience full circle.

Grow Herbs

Perhaps the easiest plants to grow, herbs can be a good place to start to interest kids in gardening. Herbs usually grow easily, so you'll probably have more than enough. Choose a few herbs to start, such as parsley, basil or rosemary. Don't worry if you have too much by summer's end. An excess of basil can be made into pesto, frozen in ice cube trays and stored in the freezer to use during the fall and winter. And, all herbs can be dried.

Start Small with Quick-Growing Plants

Create a garden with a dinner salad in mind. Plant salad greens, carrots, tomatoes and cucumbers — all are kid-friendly and easy to grow. Kids like to see the result of their effort, so consider planting crops that grow quickly such as green beans or those that produce heavily such as grape tomatoes. Sunflowers are another fun addition to the garden. They grow quickly and can be dried for the seeds.

Dig What Grows Below Ground

Harvesting roots and tubers can be a treasure hunt. What's more fun for a kid than yanking a carrot out of the ground, washing it and taking a bite? Beets, another ""underground"" crop, are colorful and can be a great way to get a child to try a new vegetable. Potatoes also are easy to grow and are kid favorites.

Gardening in Small Spaces

No yard? No problem! Try using large pots placed on the patio or porch to grow foods such as tomatoes, salad greens and even cucumbers. Most herbs can grow in small pots on indoor windowsills.

Take Gardening to the Extreme

Children are fascinated by both very small and very large objects — including vegetables. Whether in the ground or pot, cherry tomato plants grow to the perfect height for little hands to pick right off the vine. Small kids may find it exciting to watch how low-maintenance, easy-to-grow and brightly colored butternut squash and pumpkins grow and expand during the season.

Enjoy a Year-Round Harvest

The gardening experience doesn't have to end with the last outdoor harvest. Make growing edible fruits and vegetables a year-round activity. Look at seed catalogs during the cold winter months with your kids and decide what to plant next spring. Buy an indoor grow light and get started on those tomato, bean and squash plants in early spring. Kids will be fascinated by the growing process, whether it's indoors or outside.

No matter what you plant and whether your carrots look like carrots or something different, have fun. Odds are kids and parents alike will enjoy the time they spend together and learn a little something along the way. And remember: Kids are going to get dirty; that's part of the fun!",planning

1. Plan Menus and Make a List

A sure way to overspend is by wandering aimlessly through the aisles and tossing whatever looks good into your cart. Instead, plan menus and write a shopping list that corresponds with the aisles in your local store. Look for menu planning and recipe help on the supermarket's website. Many feature tools for planning and pricing meals.

2. Use Coupons and Rewards Cards

Did you know the Sunday inserts in your local paper have anywhere from $50 to $75 worth of coupons in them? Clipping coupons or printing them from websites can save you 10% to 15% on your grocery bill.

Also consider joining your supermarket's shopper's club or app. Not only will you enjoy price specials, but you may receive additional coupons for items you regularly purchase at checkout, by email or through rebates.

3. Buy Store Brands

Many shoppers say they are economizing by buying store brand products (also known as private label). Private label brands can be anywhere from 15% to 20% less expensive than their national brand counterparts while the quality of the food may match the national brand.

4. Buy On Sale and In Bulk

Cruising the aisle for sales on shelf-stable items or products you use regularly is a great way to save money. However, buy larger quantities only if you have proper storage space and will use the food before it spoils.

5. Compare Unit Prices

Use the ""unit price"" (price per pound, ounce or pint) to compare national brands with store brands, or bulk and economy-sizes with single-serve or regular-size packages. Many stores show the unit price on a shelf tag.

6. Read Food Labels

Compare nutrients using the % Daily Value on the Nutrition Facts label. Five percent or less is low — try to aim low in saturated fat and sodium. Twenty percent or more is high — try to aim high in fiber, vitamins and minerals.

7. Focus on Whole Foods

While some processed foods such as whole-grain bread and pasta, canned fruit and tofu are healthy and affordable staples, steer clear of highly processed snack and convenience foods. Aim to fill your cart mostly with vegetables, fruits, whole grains and protein foods including beans and peanut butter.

8. Shop Seasonally

Fresh produce often costs less when it's in season. You also could visit a local farmers market or join a produce club to take advantage of seasonal fruits and vegetables. For produce not in season, frozen and canned fruits and vegetables (with little or no added salt or sugar) are a nutritious option.

9. Keep Foods Safe and Prevent Food Waste

Use dating information (""sell by"" and ""best used by"") to help select the freshest foods at the market. Put cold and frozen foods in your shopping cart last and store them right away in the refrigerator and freezer. Once you're home, store foods so those with ""sell by"" dates approaching first are in front.

10. Pay Attention at Checkout

Make sure prices ring up as advertised or as indicated on the shelf label, especially for sale items. Some stores will even give you the item free if they make a mistake on the price.",planning

Reviewed:March 29, 2023","During the holy month of Ramadan, which occurs on the ninth month of the lunar-based Islamic calendar, all Muslims are required to abstain from food and drink from dawn to dusk for 30 days. Because Ramadan shifts approximately 11 days earlier each year on the solar-based Gregorian calendar, Muslims experience Ramadan in different seasons throughout the course of their lives.

The act of fasting is meant to remind Muslims of the less fortunate and to reinforce the need to be thankful. As one of the five pillars, or duties, of Islam, fasting during the month of Ramadan is mandatory for all healthy adult Muslims. Children who have not reached puberty, the elderly, those who are physically or mentally incapable of fasting, pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers and travelers are exempt.

Fasting during Ramadan means abstinence from all food or drink, including water and chewing gum, from dawn to sunset. It is recommended that before sunrise, Muslims eat a prefast meal known assuhur. This meal often resembles breakfast, but in some cultures it may include more dinner-like foods. After sundown, Muslims break their fast withiftar, a meal which usually starts with dates and water or milk, followed by dinner. Muslims are permitted to snack at night between those two meals, and hydration is encouraged, especially when Ramadan falls during summer.

Forsuhur,iftarand snacks, Muslims can more easily make it to sundown by eating high-fiber meals to sustain satiety over longer periods, fruits and vegetables to maintain electrolyte stores, and plenty of fluids to maintain hydration. Muslims should also limit fried foods and sugary sweets, the latter of which is a common cultural tradition among many ethnicities during the holy month.

After Ramadan, Muslims celebrate a three-day holiday calledEid al-Fitr, the Festival of Breaking Fasts, to commemorate the blessings and spiritual renewal from Ramadan. The first day ofEid al-Fitrstarts with a morning congregation prayer at the mosque (masjid). Muslims attend the prayer wearing their best clothes to pray together, greet friends and wish each other “Eid Mubarak,” meaning “A blessedEid.” Afterward, Muslims gather with family and friends to celebrate over food and spend quality time together.Eid al-Fitris celebrated all over the world with traditional foods that vary based on the cultural origins and family traditions. Both savory and sweet foods play an important role at many celebrations. Muslims in North Africa may celebrate withtajines, a type of slow-cooked stew that may contain meat, vegetables and fruit.Manti, a type of meat-filled dumpling, are popular among Muslims in Eastern Europe, Turkey and Asia. In Indonesia and Malaysia, beefrendang, a stew of beef cooked in coconut milk, may be prepared.Sweets also are popular and often are served with tea or Arabic coffee. Traditional choices among those of Arab heritage include an assortment of phyllo- and pistachio-based pastries such asbaklavaormaabroomeh, or the date-filled cookies calledma’amoul.Saviya, a vermicelli-based dish cooked in milk, ormithai, which means an assortment of sweets, are dishes with roots in South Asia. Butter cookies are a popular sweet treat among all regions and can be referred to asghraybehin the Middle East ornaan khataiin South Asia. Nougat, Turkish delights and sweetened rice or semolina-based porridges are also popular in several regions.Eid al-Fitralso has non-food traditions. For example, families gift toys to their children and spend time engaging in fun activities such as playing at bounce houses or face painting to celebrate this joyous occasion. Some families and friends exchange money or goody bags filled with candy and small toys, for example.Eid al-Fitralso is a time to provide charity to those in need.",cultural-cuisines-and-traditions
Make a Difference During Disability Pride Month,https://www.eatright.org/food/cultural-cuisines-and-traditions/celebratory-dates/make-a-difference-during-disability-pride-month,"Published:July 18, 2023","Celebrated annually during the month of July, Disability Pride Month is an opportunity to promote visibility and mainstream awareness of people with disabilities and a chance to honor the history, achievements, experiences and challenges faced by this community. One key challenge is the ongoing fight against systemic ableism, defined by Merriam-Webster as the “discrimination or prejudice against individuals with disabilities.”

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 27% or about one in four adults in the United States have some sort of disability. A recent U.S. Census Bureau brief indicated that in 2019, more than 4% of children in the U.S. have a disability, which is over 3 million kids. Also, disabilities in U.S. adults vary by race/ethnicity; the highest rate of disability among racial groups is American Indians/Alaska Native, with 30% of adults and nearly 6% of children having a disability.

Disabilities can be visible or go unseen and may impact mobility, hearing, vision, daily living activities such as bathing or cooking, independent living such as doing errands alone, and cognition such as difficulty concentrating to an extent that is considered serious.

Because of these disabilities, many people have been marginalized and misunderstood for generations. It is important that all disabilities and their intersecting identities be acknowledged, valued and respected. One way to do that is by learning about disabilities and taking action to support people with disabilities during Disability Pride Month.

Learn the history.

Although Section 504, Rehabilitation Act of 1973, was established to prevent discrimination for people who have disabilities, it was specific to programs and activities that received federal funding or oversight from an executive agency. In 1990, President George H.W. Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) into law. This landmark law prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities as it relates to employment and access to public services, such as health care, education and many forms of public transportation. That same year, the first Disability Pride Day was held in Boston. The first official celebration of Disability Pride Month occurred in July 2015, in conjunction with the 25th anniversary of the ADA. In addition to these celebratory dates, the first U.S.-based Disability Pride Parade was held in Chicago in 2004. Since then, Disability Pride Parades have been planned in other parts of the country and some at other times of the year. These events not only serve as celebrations of the disability community and its culture, but also are intended to motivate people to think differently about how disabilities are viewed by society and the stigma that is often associated with them.

Learn the terminology.

While some people prefer person-first language such as “people with disabilities,” others advocate for the use of disability-first language such as “disabled person,” as a means of empowerment and way to live authentically with a disability diagnosis. However, some people believe disability-first terminology and the use of phrases like “differently abled” perpetuate stigma and the idea that disability is synonymous with “less than.” Although people with certain types of disabilities, such as hearing impairment, are generally OK with being referred to as Deaf or deaf, others prefer not to be defined by their disability. “Wheelchair users” prefer to be identified as “people who use wheelchairs.” When in doubt about which terminology to use, ask someone how they would like to be referred to.

Read books on disabilities and those written by disabled authors.

There’s no better way to learn than from the people who are directly impacted by a disability. Many public libraries and bookstores offer curated collections of books written by and about people with disabilities. The National Endowment for the Humanities also offers a collection in itsVirtual Bookshelf: Disability Pride Month.

Follow disability activists.

On social media and through blogs, you can obtain a deeper understanding about the challenges faced by people with disabilities, while also learning about people on the front lines who are advocating for increased visibility, policy change, accessibility improvements and social acceptance on behalf of the disability community.

Get out and advocate.

Contact your elected officials aboutan amendmentto the Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA), which prohibits discrimination against passengers with disabilities on commercial flights. The amendment, the Air Carrier Access Amendments Act of 2021 (ACAAA), has been proposed to “strengthen accessibility in air transportation” for individuals with disabilities, including legislation to facilitate filing a grievance if discrimination based on a disability has occurred.

Support Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Access (IDEA).

All aspects of inclusion, diversity, equity, and access are relevant for people with disabilities. Also, because disability is a culture in itself, disability should be included in trainings for cultural competency and when practicing cultural humility. Disabilities are diverse in nature and type as well as within individuals with the same type of disabilities and has important implications for how people with disabilities procure food, prepare food, and eat and drink.

Work with an RDN.

Whether you are looking to support your personal health or your family's health, use the Academy'sFind a Nutrition Experttool to locate a registered dietitian nutritionist offering in-person or telehealth services in your area. For nutrition and dietetics practitioners who have a disability, work with patients and clients with disabilities, or are interested in learning more about how disabilities may impact nutrition, consider joining the Academy’sDisabilities in Nutrition and Dietetics Member Interest Group, launched in June 2023.

Check to see if your employer is disability inclusive.

The National Organization on Disability provides an employment tracker to anonymously assess benchmarks on disability inclusion. Talk with your employer to see where your company is on the scale and find solutions to help reach these benchmarks.

Hire people with disabilities.

People with disabilities work in all industries and possess many of the same skills as people without disabilities. Yet, in 2022, the jobless rate for people with a disability was about twice as high as the rate for those without a disability, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Consider hiring or helping a disabled person get hired.

Donate.

Disability is present everywhere and at every intersection of life. This means that it will impact all of us at one time or another. Choose an organization and be part of the fight for disability rights.

Reviewed:November 28, 2023","The environmental impact of the foods we eat has been getting more attention lately. Luckily, there are plenty of easy food-related actions to lighten your carbon footprint while making healthful food choices.

Buy Locally and in Season

Eating locally grown fruits and vegetables helps cut back on fossil fuels used for long-distance transport. Plus, locally produced food is likely fresher and may taste better, cost less and retain more nutrients. And, it supports local farmers and keeps dollars in the community. Look for options at the grocery store from local farms. When possible, check out local farmers markets, as well as community-supported agriculture programs, with theUSDA's Local Food Directories.

Eat More Plant-based Foods

Choosing more plant-based protein foods such as beans and lentils in place of animal-based protein foods is one way to reduce your carbon footprint. Plant-based eating styles use fewer natural resources and have been associated with less damage to the environment.

Reduce Packaging

Buying in bulk reduces the amount of plastic, paper, metal and energy that goes into manufacturing the packaging. If bulk isn't available, buy in larger packages such as ""family sizes"" rather than individual sizes. If you can, choose reusable containers and recycle materials like glass, metal, paper and plastic, if these items can be recycled in your area.

BYOB to Get Grocery

Bring your own bags. Even reusing paper or plastic supermarket bags from previous visits can lessen the impact of the  petroleum-based plastic bags used each year in the U.S., which often end up as litter, in the landfill and as a pollutant of our fresh waters and oceans.

Conserve Energy in the Kitchen

Purchase energy-efficient appliances when possible. Other energy-saving tips:

Think about what you need before you open the refrigerator or freezer to limit how long the doors stay open.

Cover the pot to heat food more quickly or use a pressure cooker.

During summer months, run the hood fan to keep gas and heat out of your kitchen so you require less air conditioning to cool the house.

Cook larger quantities and freeze in single meal portion sizes, which not only saves energy, but gets you almost instant home-cooked meals on other days.

Save Water

It is predicted that water, not fuel, will be our scarcest commodity in the not-too-distant future. So, don't let the sink faucet run.

Soak dishes in a sink of hot, soapy water to loosen food, wash and rinse all at once.

If you use a dishwasher, don't bother rinsing the dishes (just scrape them) and run the dishwasher when it is full.

Repair leaks and drips.

Install aerators in faucets to make less water more efficient.

Don't use running water to defrost frozen food; plan ahead instead and thaw it in advance in the refrigerator.

BONUS TIP: Decrease Garbage

In addition to reducing the packaging you bring home, try composting some of your food waste. Rather than filling the trash can with fruit and vegetable scraps — save them to nourish your garden. Use any container by the sink and haul it outside when it's full. Some municipalities offer free or reduced-price composting bins or bins can be purchased at local garden shops.

Use ceramic dishes and reusable silverware and cups. Avoid using disposable products. If you must use disposables, choose ones that are accepted as part of your neighborhood’s recycling program or can be composted.

Cooking Tips for One or Two,https://www.eatright.org/food/food-preparation/cooking-tips/cooking-tips-for-one-or-two,"Contributors:Sarah Klemm, RDN, CD, LDN

Reviewed:February 22, 2023","It can be tricky when cooking for one (or even two) to make the most of your ingredients and to minimize dishes — particularly when many recipes focus on making a meal for a family and serve four to six people. But just because you have a smaller household doesn't mean you should abandon the kitchen for takeout.

The first step to dinner-for-one success is by making cooking nutritious and satisfying meals a priority. Planning ahead and arming yourself with a few tips and tricks will put you on the path to triumph in the kitchen.

A helpful strategy when cooking for one is to become friends with your freezer. This way, you can cook full recipes, portion out servings and freeze them to heat up and eat later. You'll save time, money and clean up by  freezing soups, chili, pasta dishes, cooked whole grains and extra vegetables.

Here are more kitchen tips when cooking for one to two:

Grains

Cook a batch of whole grains such as brown rice or barley and freeze in individual portions using a muffin pan. Once frozen, the discs can be stored in a zip-top bag.

Have a six-pack of whole-grain English muffins or a whole loaf of bread? Tuck those extras into the freezer for another day; wrap them tightly in plastic wrap to prevent freezer burn.

Visit the bulk bins at your local grocery stores. You can buy exactly what you need with no waste and it's often less expensive per pound. In addition to grains, you can score a deal on dried herbs and spices as well as nuts, seeds and dried beans.

Veggies and Fruits

Embrace frozen produce, which can be just as nutritious as fresh and it's there when you need it. Choose options without added sauces, salt and sugar. Since they're already chopped up, frozen fruits and veggies are ready to add to smoothies, soups and stir-fries. And because they're frozen, there is no rush to use them before they spoil.

Bulk bags of fruits and veggies are only a better deal if you eat them before they spoil. Buy only what you can reasonably eat before the produce perishes: take extra grapes or cherries out of the bag and pare down that bunch of bananas to what you'll eat.

Enjoy your most perishable fresh produce, such as berries and spinach, early in the week. Save heartier produce including cabbage, carrots and potatoes for meals later in the week.

Protein: Meat, Poultry, Eggs, Beans

Unopened blocks of tofu can be frozen and then thawed in the refrigerator when you're ready to prepare it. This makes the texture spongier and better at soaking up sauces and flavor.

Eggs can be hard-boiled ahead of time and eaten over the next few days for an easy breakfast, snack or quick addition to salad.

Buy a whole package of meat or poultry and wrap individual portions in freezer-safe paper; label each with the date and contents.

Cooked dried beans are super affordable, versatile and may be frozen for later use. Thaw in the refrigerator or microwave.

A potato masher can easily transform a can of pinto beans into delicious, refried beans — a pinch of cumin, garlic and chili powder and you're ready to eat!",food-preparation

Studies show that breakfast eaters tend to have higher school attendance, less tardiness and fewer hunger-induced stomach aches in the morning. Their overall test scores are higher, they concentrate better, solve problems more easily and have better muscle coordination. Children who eat breakfast also are more likely to maintain a healthy weight and get enough calcium, too. Whether your children eat at home or at school, be sure they eat a nutritious breakfast every day.

Whip Up a Quick and Easy Morning Meal

Start your child's day in a healthful direction with a balanced breakfast that incorporates a variety of nutrient-dense foods. Try some of these quick and easy options:

Peanut butter spread on whole-grain toast

Grits and eggs

Porridge with ginger and cinnamon

Oyster omelet oromurice(fried rice omelet)

Chilaquiles with eggs

Iron-fortified cereal with milk or fortified non-dairy alternative and banana slices

Instant oatmeal topped with chopped walnuts and sliced strawberries

Dosa(lentil and rice crepe)plain or stuffed with curried potatoes and chutney

Smoothie including milk or fortified non-dairy alternative, spinach, frozen banana and nut butter

Parfait with layers of yogurt, whole-grain granola and blueberries

Ful mudammas— fava bean salad with parsley, tomatoes, green onion, lemon juice and extra-virgin olive oil

Make a Breakfast Bar

Let your kids build their own breakfast with a breakfast bar. Similar to a salad bar, a breakfast bar includes a variety of foods to mix and match. Little ones love to create unusual combinations by mixing, stacking and organizing ingredients. Will peanut butter glue the berries to a waffle? Or will yogurt smother nuts and fruit? No matter what nutritious combinations they create, they will love the sense of control a breakfast bar offers. Here are some ideas:

Whole-grain cereals, waffles, tortillas, bread or English muffins

Peanut butter

Low-fat or fat-free yogurt

Cottage cheese

Olives

Fig or apricot jam

Variety of sliced fruit such as bananas strawberries, papaya or passionfruit

Cooked apples or fruit compote

Cheese slices

Chopped nuts such as cashews or pistachios

Raisins and dried cranberries

Low-fat or fat-free milk or soy milk

Hard-boiled eggs

Jazz Up Cooked Cereal

For a great grain-filled breakfast, add flavor and nutrition to cooked cereals (instant or not), such as oatmeal, cream of wheat, grits, brown rice or whole-grain couscous.

Use fruit juice — apple, orange or another 100% juice — or low-fat or fat-free milk as the cooking liquid.

For cooked cereal, stir in chopped fruit (apple, peach, banana, kiwifruit), dried fruit (chopped apricots, papaya, dates, raisins, cranberries) or nuts and seeds.

Add dry milk powder to cooked cereal to boost calcium.

Liven it up with spices: cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, allspice or cloves.

If eating breakfast at home simply isn't an option for your child, find out if school breakfast is available. Or pack them a breakfast-to-go that they can eat on the bus or when they get to school. You will not only be encouraging your children to eat nutritiously, but also fueling their growing bodies and minds for success.",planning

Have a wild appetite? Recently, more game meat— wild animals and birds — has been making its way from the farm to your table.

From elk, deer, moose, caribou and antelope to goose, pheasant and quail, the variety and availability of farm-raised game continues to grow.

If you plan to adventure into the game meat territory, remember this quick guide for safe handling and cooking tips for meat from game animals.

Where Does Game Meat Come From?

Game animals may be raised on farms or ranches or, in some cases, hunted. For ranch-raised game, the animals are able to roam and eat from the land. Farm-raised game live in more confined outdoor areas and feed on grains such as wheat, alfalfa or corn.

Since their diets and activity levels differ from those of domestic animals and poultry, the meat of farm-raised game animals has a different flavor — stronger than domesticated species, but milder than wild game.

How Do I Know Game Meat Is Safe?

Just like domestic meats, some game animals are inspected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and others, by the Food and Drug Administration.

The USDA has mandatory inspection authority over all food products from cattle, sheep, swine, goats, turkey, ducks, geese, chicken and much more. The USDA also does voluntary inspection of reindeer, elk, deer, antelope, water buffalo, bison, migratory water fowl, game birds and rabbits.

The FDA has jurisdiction over imported game not covered by the federal meat and poultry inspection laws. Meat and poultry exported from another country, must meet all safety standards applied to foods produced in the United States.

How to Cook Game Meats

As with other meats, it's important to cook game meat to a safe minimum internal temperature to eliminate harmful foodborne pathogens. Be sure to use a food thermometer to ensure that meats are thoroughly cooked.

You can also download our ""Is My Food Safe?"" app for a pocket-guide on cooking game to safe temperatures.

And as always, when you prepare game meat, reduce your risk of food poisoning with the basic food safety principles of: Wash, Separate, Cook and Refrigerate.

Lastly, keep in mind too that most game tends to be leaner than that of domesticated animals, so cook game meat slowly to keep it tender.",home-food-safety
Fares of Faith: Mawlid un-Nabi,https://www.eatright.org/food/cultural-cuisines-and-traditions/holidays-and-celebrations/mawlid-un-nabi,"Contributors:Nour Zibdeh, MS, RD, CLT
Published:July 24, 2023","Around the world, many Muslims celebrate the birth of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)* with feasts, festivals, street parades, chants and decorations in streets, mosques and homes.

Mawlid un-Nabi— also referred to asEid Al-Mawlid Annabawiin certain Arabic dialects (eidmeans feast or celebration;mawlidmeans birth andun-Nabimeans prophet) — is observed by Sunni Muslims on the 12th ofRabi’ Al-Awwal, the third month in the Islamic calendar, or on the 17th of the same month by Shiite Muslims. Because the Islamic calendar is lunar, the holiday shifts by about 10 days every year on the Gregorian calendar.

Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), the prophet of Islam, was born in A.D. 570 in Mecca, now Saudi Arabia. There are no mentions of celebrations of the Prophet’s birth during his lifetime; in fact, the first large-scale celebrations took place in 1207 in the city of Irbil, then known as Arabala and located in modern-day Iraq. These were led by the city’s Sufi missionaries, who spread the celebrations throughout Egypt during the Fatimid Dynasty. Later that century, the Mamluk Sultans in Egypt ornamented the celebrations by decorating the streets with lamps and silk cloths. Sufi groups and singers performed at Cairo’s Citadel and gifts were given to soldiers and the poor.

Today,Mawlid un-Nabiis an official holiday in Muslim countries, from its Middle Eastern origins to Africa to Malaysia, where the holiday is known asMaulidur Rasul. The celebrations in Egypt are still the largest in scale in the Middle East and Sufi Muslims continue to be the biggest devotees of this holiday. Some Muslim groups, such as Salafi and Wahabi, do not observeMawlid un-Nabi. They believe that since the prophet didn’t celebrate his birthday during his life, they should follow suit.During celebrations, food is distributed to the poor and people gather in mosques and streets to pray, recite the Qur’an (the Holy book for Muslims) and listen to poetry and songs that praise Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), his life, qualities, accomplishments and teachings. Many Muslims celebrate the day by fasting or abstaining from food or drinks from dawn until sunset.

Food is an important part of the celebrations. Desserts such as baklava, rice pudding or semolina porridge are eaten in countries all over the world. Honey is the sweetener of choice.Tharid, ortharida, a meat and vegetable broth served over crispy bread and thought to be Prophet Muhammad’s (PBUH) favorite dish, is often served. While it originated in the Arabian Peninsula, the type of meat, spices and vegetables can vary from one region to another, yielding a savory, spicy or sweet meal.

Other foods served duringMawlid un-Nabivary among cultures, based on local traditions:

Egypt: Hummus, sweets and pink colored candies shaped like knights on horses are common (horse candies also are shared in Sudan). Fried fritters calledmshabbakmade of wheat, sugar, butter and eggs are sometimes served.

India and Pakistan: Muslims eat spicy rice and meat dishes, as well as sweet rice dishes. While camel meat is considered holiest for the occasion, goat and mutton are more common in this region.

Kenya: Shrimp pilaf, curried eggplant, cassava with coconut sauce, mango chutney and roasted red pepper may be served as part of the celebrations.

Lebanon and the Middle East: Here, people may feast on tabbouleh and roasted chicken stuffed with rice, spices and ground lamb (djaj mihshi). Dessert can bemshabbakor baklava.

North Africa: Muslims enjoyaseeda(orasida), a dough-based dessert usually eaten warm by hand and made from cooked wheat flour, butter and honey.

Malaysia: While celebrations and street parades can be massive in Malaysia, specific holiday food is not as emphasized. People often enjoy local street foods, and boxed meals may be distributed at the end of the parades.

*Whenever Muslims say or hear the name of the Islamic prophet, they follow it with a salutation known in Arabic assalawat. In English, the most common of these phrases is “Sallah Allahu Alaihi wa Sallam,” or “peace be upon him,” which some Muslims shorten to the abbreviation “PBUH.” In fact, Muslims send salutations after the name of any religious prophet, such as Moses or Abraham, by saying, “Alaihi Alsalatu wa Assalam.” For non-Muslims engaging with Muslim communities, using the phrase “peace be upon him” after an Islamic prophet’s name would be considered a gesture of respect, but it is understandable if it were omitted since it is not part of the culture of non-Muslims.",cultural-cuisines-and-traditions

Kids will not only get to try the new foods they prepare, but also get a big boost to their confidence when they see family and friends enjoying their creations. Most importantly, cooking with your children will promote future health by teaching them about nutrition and how to prepare healthy meals.

Safety Precautions

To be safe, cover a few ground rules before getting started in the kitchen. Teach kids to wash their hands with clean, running water while soaping up and singing two choruses of ""Happy Birthday"" to wash away germs.

Teaching Basics

To begin cooking, teach your child the basics, such as cracking an egg or gathering the ingredients for a favorite holiday recipe. Explain to your child the importance of measuring the correct amount of each ingredient and the different types of utensils you need to use.

Look Who's Cooking!

To keep your children enthusiastic about cooking, assign steps of a holiday recipe that they are able to do based on their abilities. Here are some ideas depending on your child's age (Note: Each child’s ability to learn a new task may vary):

2- to 3-year-olds:wash fresh produce, snap green beans, tear lettuce for a salad, press cookie cutters

3- to 5-year-olds:mix together simple ingredients, spread ingredients such as frosting or butter

5- to 7-year-olds:shuck corn, crack eggs, dip items

7- to 9-year-olds:measure ingredients, use a can opener, check the temperature of foods with a thermometer, pound chicken on a cutting board

10-year-olds or older:slice or chop vegetables, microwave foods, bake foods in the oven, simmer ingredients on the stove

Remember to allow your child to gradually master cooking methods. Start with simple techniques such as rolling dough, using a cookie cutter or spreading frosting. Give your child time to work their way up to completing the entire cookie making process, from pouring liquids into batter to baking foods in the oven. Explain different methods for cooking and their purpose, such as baking versus broiling and how you would cook different dishes.",cultural-cuisines-and-traditions

Whole grains (such as buckwheat, brown rice and oatmeal) are nutritious because they contain the fiber-rich outer bran layer, the nutrient-packed germ and the starchy endosperm. Refined grains (such as white bread, white pasta and white rice) contain only the endosperm.

In addition to their dietary fiber content, which promotes digestive and heart health, whole grains also provide vitamins and minerals, antioxidants and other healthy plant-based nutrients. No matter which whole grain you prefer, make sure the ingredient list includes whole grains or that the label reads ""100% whole grain.""

Amaranth

A gluten-free grain, amaranth is considered a complete protein because it contains all of the essential amino acids in proportions that humans need — including lysine, which most grains tend to lack. Additionally, a ½ cup of cooked amaranth is a good source of minerals such as iron and selenium. In South America, amaranth is popped like miniature popcorn. Most kids love pasta, and amaranth can be used as a substitute for couscous or orzo. Use amaranth flour to make tasty baked goods such as zucchini bread, carrot cake or banana nut muffins and pancakes.

Barley

Barley is a fiber powerhouse. Hulled barley has more fiber-rich bran than pearled barley, but both contain beta-glucan soluble fiber that slows the absorption of glucose, and helps to keep blood sugar levels stable, thus providing sustained energy throughout the day. Barley also contains selenium, a powerful antioxidant. Barley is great added to soups or used to make pilaf. It can even be made into a hot breakfast cereal. Hulled barley will take more time to cook than pearled barley (which is not a whole grain), about 50 to 60 minutes.

Oats

Oats also contain beta-glucan fiber which can lower cholesterol and help support the immune system. Oats boast polyphenol compounds that laboratory studies show have antioxidant properties. Besides the age-old favorite oatmeal for breakfast, oats can be added as a binder to meatloaf and burgers. Oats also work well in baked goods including oatmeal cookies, as a crunchy topping to crisps and crumbles, and even in casserole dishes.

Quinoa

Like amaranth, quinoa contains all nine essential amino acids in the proper portions and is gluten-free. Moreover, a ½ cup of cooked quinoa is an excellent source of magnesium and contributes iron and folate. And, quinoa is easy to make. While not required, toasting quinoa before boiling it in liquid enhances flavor, as does cooking it in vegetable broth. Quinoa can be made in a rice cooker, too. Before cooking, use a fine mesh strainer to rinse the quinoa to remove compounds called saponins that can give the quinoa a bitter taste. Quinoa is fun for kids because it pops in the mouth when chewed and comes in several colors: beige, red, black and even purple. Mix quinoa with beans or nuts for a tasty side dish or add to salads and stir-fries.

Teff

Another gluten-free grain, teff provides about 5 grams of protein per half cup. Teff is a great source of thiamin (a B vitamin), and also is a good source of fiber, iron and magnesium. Teff grains are tiny and have a mild nutty flavor. It's an indispensable grain in Ethiopia where it's used to make the traditional flat bread, injera, and now it's grown in several areas of the United States. Cook the grain into a creamy hot cereal or a tasty polenta. You also can mix teff with veggies for a side dish.",food-groups

Published:November 01, 2018
Reviewed:November 04, 2024","The word “banana” stems from the Arabic wordbanan, meaning finger. Originating in Southeast Asia, the banana planted new roots in the Middle East, West Africa and Europe, and eventually arrived in the Americas by way of Spanish and Portuguese explorers. The United States is now the second-largest importer of bananas, behind only the European Union.

Nutritionally Speaking

A medium-sized banana has approximately 105 calories, but its nutrition profile may vary depending on ripeness and size. Over time, starch degradation causes the fruit to ripen, increasing the availability of sugars. This makes a ripe banana’s energy more readily available to the body.

Athletes adore bananas for good reason: They are easily digestible and provide nutrients that help replenish energy stores lost during strenuous activity. Just one medium banana contains 9% of the Daily Value for potassium, 11% for vitamin C and 25% for vitamin B6. Research shows consuming a banana with water before exercise may be as effective at supporting performance as a sports drink.

Bananas also contain the prebiotic compound fructooligosaccharide, which nourishes flora in the gut and may help boost the immune system. Because bananas are a good source of dietary fiber, they are touted as beneficial foods for good digestive health.

Growing

Bananas require a tropical climate for growth; with Central America and the Caribbean being top exporters of bananas throughout the world. Green bananas are harvested on farms, then placed into a room where ethylene gas is pumped in and out to enhance the ripening process. When the color begins to “break,” meaning a yellow hue is faintly seen, bananas are packaged and shipped to retailers. The remainder of the ripening continues naturally en route.

The high demand for bananas has drawn environmental concerns. Although thousands of varieties exist, the familiar crescent-shaped Cavendish banana accounts for the majority of the world’s exports. To meet supply needs and earn a profit, farmers are widely practicing monocropping, which depletes the soil’s nutrients and makes bananas susceptible to pests.

Bananas are available all year round.

Purchasing

You can purchase bananas unripe (full green in color) to very ripe (yellow with brown spots) and all the hues in between. Avoid bananas with moist, dark areas on the banana skin, which indicates the fruit is bruised on the inside.  You’ll also find dried banana chips and frozen banana slices at your local grocer.

Storing

The best place to store bananas is on a countertop, away from direct sunlight. Bananas will continue to ripen at room temperature. You can buy a banana hanger, which helps keep the fruit from bruising. It may sound strange but wrapping the stems of a banana bunch in plastic can help keep bananas fresh and yellow for longer. Why? Banana stems produce ethylene gas which spreads down the fruit, ripening the banana faster. The plastic wrapping helps contain the gas, preventing it from getting to the banana.

Once bananas hit their perfect ripeness, store what you don’t eat in the freezer. Peel the bananas first and place the fruit in a sealed plastic bag or container — either whole or cut. You can freeze bananas with the peel on them, but it is more difficult to remove the peel once frozen.

Storing bananas in the fridge is not recommended because it may cause chilling injury, which can cause a bitter flavor and discoloration of the banana flesh.

Preparing

While most people peel bananas by breaking the stem, consider flipping your banana upside down to peel it, just like monkeys do! Pinch the bottom tip of the banana to make a small opening. Peel back the skin one section at a time to eat, using the stem as a handle.

Bananas discolor quickly, so don’t cut them until you’re ready to eat. Sprinkling banana slices with a little lemon juice will lower the pH level and help keep them from browning. Store sliced banana in the fridge, wrapped tightly in plastic or in an airtight container, for three to four days.

Using

Bananas are equally enjoyed in sweet and savory dishes. The flesh of a banana most closely resembles a plantain in the unripe stage, when its durable texture can withstand high cooking temperatures. After slicing into chunks, pan-fry unripe banana with fresh rosemary or toss into a spicy chicken curry.

The starch and simple sugars in ripe bananas are ideal as a nutritious replacement for granulated sugar. Mashing or creaming overripe bananas creates a batter base for sweet breads, muffins and pancakes. Frozen bananas can be used in smoothies or to make an ice cream alternative. Dried banana slices are a sweet addition to homemade trail mix.

Bananas are also amazing on their own — eat them whole or enjoy sliced bananas in fruit salads, yogurt, oatmeal and other cereals for a touch of natural sweetness.

Before You Hit the Road

When you're picnicking, tailgating or barbecuing, things can get messy. To make sure you have all the essentials you'll need for quick and easy cleanup, pack a bottle or bar of soap and clean towels. You'll also need clean water. Try to find out ahead of time if you'll have access to fresh water at your destination. If not, bring a few jugs of water from home. If that's not possible, pack disposable wipes to clean hands and surfaces before and after cooking and eating.

After the Fun Is Done

Melted ice is a sign that the temperature has dropped and your food is no longer safe to eat. It's time to toss all leftovers. While you're at it, immediately throw out all used bags and wrappers so they don't contaminate your cooler.

Scrub It, Then Store It

At the end of the picnic or as soon as you return home, clean your cooler with water and a mild detergent and rinse thoroughly. Then, make sure to wipe it completely dry before storing. If lingering odors are an issue, a quick wipe with a vanilla extract-soaked paper towel can freshen things up. Finally, if your cooler has a drain plug, make sure it's open to prevent moisture from accumulating during storage.",home-food-safety

Unfortunately, poor nutrition, lack of hydration and fierce sunburn can leave you wiped out after a supposedly relaxing beach day. Make the most of your hard-earned rest time by giving your beach day a healthy makeover.

Bring Healthy Snacks

The prices at beachside cafes and hot dog stands can add up. Save money and eat well by bringing snacks with you, such as:

Raw or dry-roasted nuts

Pre-washed and cut fruit and veggies (packed in a cooler)

Whole-grain crackers

Roasted chickpeas

Trail mix

Dried mixed fruit

If you do purchase food at the beach, look for nourishing and refreshing foods such as  hummus wraps and smoothie bowls. Also look for tasty choices such as grilled corn on the cob, fruit popsicles, low-fat frozen yogurt topped with fresh fruit, baked chips, grilled chicken salads and sandwiches on whole-grain bread.

When packing a cooler for the beach, don't forget plenty of water! Refresh yourself on a hot day with a reusable bottle of ice cold water with lemon or mint. If you crave something fizzy, hydrate with sparkling water.

Protect Your Food

A beach day is relaxing; a bout of food poisoning is anything but. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 1 in 6 Americans get sick from foodborne diseases each year. Pack your beach snacks cautiously and don't leave food sitting out for longer than two hours, or one hour if the temperature reaches 90°F or higher.

Before you pack for your day at the beach, give your cooler and tote a thorough cleaning. Always start with aclean cooler, washing it out with mild soap and water and rinsing thoroughly. It's also important to thoroughly wash containers and re-useable bags to remove all food residues and minimize the potential for bacterial growth.

Pack your coolerwith plenty of ice if you're bringing perishable foods to the beach. Your cooler must maintain food at a temperature of 40°F or lower. Keep a thermometer in your cooler and, if possible, store coolers in the shade.

If you're cooking out at the beach, follow these do's and don'ts:

Dousedifferent platesand utensils to handle meat, including separate sets for raw and cooked meat.

Dobring a food thermometer to make sure grilled meats reach a safe internal temperature (160°F for hamburgers, 165°F for chicken).

Don'tthaw frozen meat in the sun.

Don'tstart cooking meat, store it and then finish it later on the grill. This causes bacteria to multiply.

Some beaches don't have facilities with running water, so pack hand sanitizer and use it before and after cooking or eating food. Also, bring some empty bags for your garbage — don't leave your trash on the beach!

Stay Hydrated

Don't get so caught up playing in the water that you forgetto drinkwater. Summer heat combined with swimming exertion can leave you dehydrated. You may not notice you're sweating when you're in and out of the water. Drinking fluids and consuming a wide variety of foods can help you remain hydrated when the temperatures rise. Watermelon is a great hydrating snack for a summer day at the beach.

A cold beer may sound appealing on a hot day, but drink alcohol cautiously and in moderation. Drinking too much alcohol and swimming is dangerous. Alcohol consumption can affect our coordination and judgment. Your risk of drowning increases as your blood alcohol concentration rises. Alcohol also is a mild diuretic, increasing urine output, which can hasten dehydration. Dehydration warning signs include:

Thirst

Headache

Dry mouth

Decreased urine output

Sleepiness or tiredness

Dizziness or lightheadedness

Mild dehydration can be treated by drinking water, but if you experience more severe symptoms (extreme thirst, lack of sweat or tears, a rapid heartbeat, weakness, breathing rapidly or delirium), call 911 immediately. Severe dehydration is a medical emergency.

Enjoy a healthy day at the beach — fuel your body with nutrient-rich snacks, practice food safety and stay hydrated. Finally,don't forget the sunscreen!",home-food-safety

Kitchen Surfaces

Illness-causing bacteria can be found lurking in many places in your kitchen. To avoid unintentionally spreading bacteria to food, be sure to properly wash hands, utensils, cutting boards and other surfaces.

Keep countertops clean by washing with hot, soapy water before and after preparing food. Remember to clean appliances and cutting boards, as well.

Keepingcutting boardsand surfaces clean, and followingproper sponge safety, helps reduce bacteria and prevent cross-contamination.

As an optional extra step, sanitize surfaces and utensils with a solution of 1 tablespoon of unscented, liquid chlorine bleach per gallon of water.

Refrigerator

Remember to check the refrigerator and freezer and clean the shelving and drawers where bacteria can hide. Bacteria that cause foodborne illness aren't always visible, so be sure all surfaces — including small crevices — are cleaned well.

Check that the refrigerator temperature is set below 40°F.

Look for unnoticed spills and remove lingering odors. Wipe up spills and clean surfaces with hot, soapy water and rinse well. Be sure to clean under drawers and edges of glass shelves.

To keep the refrigerator smelling fresh and help eliminate odors, place an opened box of baking soda on a shelf. Avoid using solvent cleaning agents, abrasives and any cleansers that may impart a chemical taste to food or ice cubes, or cause damage to the interior finish of your refrigerator. Follow the manufacturer's instructions.

Shelf Life

Make sure foods haven't spoiled in the pantry or in the refrigerator.

Check for foods that are losing their quality or have spoiled — whether in the refrigerator, freezer or pantry.

Make spring the time to begin new food safety habits. To minimize food waste, check the refrigerator regularly to be sure foods are eaten before they spoil. Once a week, throw out or compost perishable foods that are past their prime and should no longer be eaten.",home-food-safety
8 Food Safety Tips When Traveling Abroad,https://www.eatright.org/food/planning/away-from-home/8-food-safety-tips-when-traveling-abroad,"Contributors:Barbara Gordon, RDN, LD
Published:November 30, 2022
Reviewed:December 02, 2022","Your travel plans are set. Your passport is ready. But, do you know what might be lurking in the food on your plate as you travel outside the U.S.? The World Health Organization estimates that 2 million people die each year from contaminated food or drinking water. That’s about 1 in 10 people!

Risks range from:

Mild: travelers' diarrhea.

Serious: hepatitis A or typhoid, which can have long-term health effects.

Fatal: illness caused by harmful bacteria, parasites, viruses and chemical substances.

If you're traveling, follow these tips:

Tip #1 Plan Ahead

Research your destination.Anticipate issues, food safety or otherwise, that could arise during your trip.

Find out about the water supply.Check if your destination has a drinkable water supply and medical care that is available in case you do become ill. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Travelers' Health and U.S. Department of State Travel Information are two excellent resources.

Check the altitude.Some people can become sick above 8,000 feet, especially children.

Tip #2: Visit a Health Care Provider Before You Go

Find out about vaccines.Depending on where you're traveling, you may need new or updated vaccines.

Stock up on prescriptions.Get enough of your prescription drugs to last the entire trip. If need be, request a vacation exception to get enough for the whole time you will be gone. Also, fill prescriptions for any recommended special medications.

Don't forget over-the-counter medications.Consider bringing over-the-counter medications with you in case you experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, heartburn or gas. Talk to your doctor about recommendations.

Tip #3: Pack Smartly

Carry hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes.These can be used for washing your hands and cleaning surfaces.

Stash nonperishable food items(that aren't liquids)in your carry-on luggage.Although many airports offer healthy options, you never know when will be the next time you can eat once you reach your destination. If you aren't sure if options are available, pack extra nonperishables in your luggage.

Bring atravel health kit.And, carry your health insurance card in your wallet. Place prescription drugs in your carry-on luggage. Check theTSA websiteto determine what's allowed on airplanes.

Whenever in doubt, don't drink tap or well water or anything that was made with it, including fountain drinks.Your best bet is to opt for sealed, bottled beverages.

Tip #4: Keep Your Guard Up

Avoid raw meat, fish, shellfish and eggs.Just as in the U.S., you can get sick from undercooked, raw and contaminated foods and beverages.

Avoid raw produce, including salads, advises the FDA.This will reduce the possibility of coming in contact with fruits and vegetables that may have been rinsed with tap water and may be contaminated. However, thoroughly cooked produce; fruits with a thick, intact peel or a covering that you can peel yourself (such as citrus fruits and bananas); well-cooked meat, poultry and fish; and dairy from large commercial dairies are considered safe by the FDA.

Tip #5: Always Err On the Side of Caution

Steer clear of food that has been sitting at room temperature.That falls within the temperature ""danger zone"" where bacteria thrive. This includes not eating from a buffet-style service, since food may not always be held at safe temperatures and can easily become mishandled. Stick to cold or hot foods instead.

Tip #6: Watch Out for All Water Sources

If you have to ask, don’t drink it.A common question travelers ask when abroad: ""Is the water safe?"" The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends avoiding tap water, including cocktails, ice and water to brush your teeth. Undrinkable tap water can be contaminated with amoebas, parasites and viruses including hepatitis.

Choose drinks in manufacturer-sealed containers. For example, bottled or canned beverages and pasteurized dairy products.

Tip #7: Wash Your Hands

Clean your hands often.Whether at home or abroad,proper hand-washingis an important key to preventing foodborne illness.

Use soap or hand sanitizer.Wash your hands with soap and warm water, especially before eating and after using the bathroom. When soap and warm water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer instead. Pack it in your carry-on, purse or backpack for easy access.

Tip #8: Take Care of Yourself if You Get Sick

Stay hydrated.Even if you play it safe and follow the rules for food safety, you still may find yourself sick while on an international trip. If you experience diarrhea, drink plenty of clean fluids.

Seek help if you need medical treatment.If you experience a more serious illness, theU.S. Department of Statecan help travelers locate medical services.

They also have fewer behavior problems and are less likely to be tardy. Eating breakfast also can help children maintain a healthy weight. Unfortunately, studies show many children don’t eat breakfast every day.

A high-octane carbohydrate source energizes the body and brain for a busy day with fiber and nutrients. Think whole-grain cereal (hot or cold), bread, tortillas, muffins, waffles or even leftover rice or pasta. Protein often is a missing link in morning meals and it’s needed to go strong until lunch. Think a slice of Canadian bacon, an egg, a slice of lean deli meat or low-fat cheese, a container of low-fat yogurt, a scoop of low-fat cottage cheese, a cup of milk or a handful of nuts.

Breakfast is a perfect time to enjoy fruits and vegetables children need for optimal health. Try fresh seasonal fruit alone or in cereal, add frozen fruits to yogurt or toss chopped vegetables into an omelet.

Healthy Breakfasts for Busy Mornings

Get the morning nutrition you need with these quick breakfast ideas.

Instant oatmeal:Make it with fat-free or low-fat milk instead of water. Toss in raisins or dried cranberries and chopped walnuts. Or mix in ¼ cup unsweetened applesauce and sprinkle with apple pie spice or cinnamon.

Yogurt parfait:Layer fat-free or low-fat plain yogurt with your crunchy cereal and blueberries.

Breakfast smoothie:Blend low-fat milk, frozen strawberries and a banana.

Toaster waffle:Toast and top with nut butter and apple slices.

Pita egg sandwich:Stuff a whole-wheat pita with a sliced, hard-cooked egg and low-fat shredded cheese.

Banana roll-up:Spread peanut butter on a whole-wheat tortilla. Add a peeled, whole banana and roll it up.

Bagel and veggies:Spread hummus on a whole-grain toasted bagel. Top with sliced cucumbers and tomatoes.

English muffin:Add lean ham and low-fat Swiss cheese to a toasted whole-grain English muffin.

If your taste buds just don't crave breakfast foods, try these:

Deli turkey, a slice of low-fat cheese and lettuce wrapped in a tortilla.

Leftover quinoa or brown rice mixed with low-fat yogurt, dried fruit and nuts. Sprinkle with cinnamon.

Get Yourself Prepped

While breakfast might seem like a hurdle in your busy morning, nutritious food doesn't need to take extra time to prepare. Try the following tips:

Get organized the night before.Get out a pan for pancakes or a blender for smoothies. Prepare muffin or waffle mix so it's ready to cook in the morning. Set out a few boxes of whole-grain cereal for kids to choose — all they'll have to do in the morning is add milk.

Set the alarm 10 minutes earlier.Hectic mornings can make it difficult for kids (and parents) to find time for breakfast. Waking up just a few minutes earlier provides time to squeeze in a quick morning meal.

Pack your breakfast to go.If there's no time to eat at home, plan a nutritious option to eat on the bus or when you arrive at work. Busy teens can grab a banana, a bag of trail mix and a carton of milk. Don't forget to see if your school offers a breakfast program.

Help make sure your kids have an appetite.Many kids aren't hungry for breakfast because they snack too much at night. Try offering lighter snacks in the evening and you might be surprised how much hungrier they are in the morning. In addition, try having your children dress first and eat second. Kids are more likely to feel hungry once they have a chance to wake up.

Be a positive role model.Children will mimic their parents' behavior, so make it a habit to sit down and eat a nutritious breakfast with your kids every morning.

Whatever your morning routine, remember that breakfast is an important meal for the family, and doesn't have to be very time-consuming. When you eat well in the morning, you and your family will be on the nutrition fast track for a high-energy day. Surprise them with Strawberry Banana Cereal — try the recipe below!

Food Safety Basics

Before you enter the kitchen, cover the ground rules with children first:

Wash handswith warm or cold water and soap before and after handling food.

Pull back long hair, off the shoulders.

Keepcounter topsand working surfaces clean.

Teach children to wait until food is cooked before tasting. Don't let them lick their fingers or put their hands in their mouths, especially when working with raw foods such ascookie doughand raw meat or poultry.

Avoid double dipping or putting spoons back into food after using them for tasting.

Remember, young cooks need supervision.

Age-Appropriate Kitchen Tasks for Kids

These basics are helpful guidelines for children and adults of all ages. However, it may take more or less time for some children to be able to complete certain tasks.

2- to 3-year-olds

Young children love helping out but need very close adult supervision since their motor skills are still developing. Teach these youngsters the importance of washing produce and using clean appliances and utensils.

Appropriate Tasks:

Wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds. Make it a game by singing the ""Happy Birthday"" song together twice as you wash your hands.

Wash fruits and vegetables in the sink with cool tap water.

Wipe down tabletops.

Snap green beans.

Cut cookies into fun shapes with cookie cutters (but don't eat the raw dough!).

3- to 5-year-olds

Appropriate Tasks:

Mix ingredients such as pancake or other batters.

Brush (or ""paint"") cooking oil on bread, asparagus or other foods with a clean pastry or basting brush.

Break eggs into a bowl and wash hands afterwards.

Mash potatoes.

5- to 7-year-olds

Most 5- to 7-year-olds have developed fine motor skills, so they can handle more detailed work, but they will still need food safety reminders.

Appropriate Tasks:

Scoop out avocados after sliced in half by an adult.

Load the dishwasher.

Shuck corn and rinse before cooking.

Rinse and cut parsley or green onions with clean, blunt kitchen shears.

7- to 9-year-olds

There is a wide range of skills in this age group, so tailor your tasks to each child's maturity level. Teach the importance of wiping down all surfaces andrefrigerating perishables, such as eggs and milk, right away.

Open cans with a can opener.

Putleftoversin shallow containers and refrigerate within two hours (one hour if it’s warmer than 90 degrees Fahrenheit).

Pound chicken on a cutting board. Note: Always use a separate cutting board for ready-to-eat and raw foods, and be sure to wash hands with warm, soapy water after handling raw meats and chicken.

Beat eggs.

Check the temperature of meat with afood thermometer— it's like a science experiment!

Use a peeler to peel raw potatoes, ginger, mangoes and other washed fruits and vegetables.

9- to 12-year-olds

For the most part, kids ages 9 to 12 can work independently in the kitchen, but should still have adult supervision. Before letting these kids do grown-up tasks on their own, assess whether they can follow basic kitchen rules such as adjusting pan handles over counters to avoid bumping into them, unplugging electrical appliances, using knives and safely using the oven or microwave.

Appropriate Tasks(with adult supervision):

Boil pasta.

Microwave foods.

Follow a recipe, including reading each step in order and measuring ingredients accurately.

Bake foods in the oven.

Simmer ingredients on the stove.

Slice or chop vegetables.

Cooking together can be a fun way to teach your child valuable skills, promote good nutrition and make long-lasting memories in the process.",home-food-safety

With rising prices and falling budgets, it's more challenging than ever to bring home the fixings for balanced meals. But, saving money at the supermarket doesn't mean giving up nutritious foods. Here are some tips to save you money while nourishing your family.

Get into a Frugal Frame of Mind

Be healthier to be wealthier.Consider the money you'll save down the road by eating well today and teaching your family to make wise food choices. Good nutrition could mean fewer days missed from work and school and fewer medical bills now and in the future.

Expect to spend a little extra time buying groceries — at least at first.Making lists, checking store flyers and comparing unit prices on packages take time. Give it a few weeks, and you'll get faster.

Make your mantra: Raw, whole and bulk.Raw and whole foods are not prepared or processed so these items usually cost less than buying their precooked and ready-to-eat counterparts. Buying staples in bulk also can mean some huge savings on those family favorites. Look for items, like breakfast cereals, in bulk which can really put a dent in your budget.

Fall in love with your freezer.When you prepare a recipe, double it and put the extra portions in the freezer. You’ll be glad it’s there on that night when nothing goes as planned. Instead of calling for home delivery, you can quickly heat up a delicious meal that you know your family loves. When freezing, add a date to the outside package and eat the items with the earlier dates first.

At Home

Keep a running grocery list.Each trip to the supermarket will cost you extra time and gas money. By keeping a list, you won't have to run out for single items. Plus, fewer trips to the grocery store means fewer impulse buys.

Plan your menus around the sales.Planning is key. Review several supermarket flyers or look for their specials online. You'll save the most money on sales for meats. When creating your menus, have a plan for leftovers such as making sandwiches with extra servings of chicken or pot roast.

Keep up with your favorite brands on social media.You'll find some great bargains and coupons this way.

Grow your own.Plant tomatoes, peppers, carrots, lettuce and more. Save money, have fun and get better flavor at the same time.

Cook more meals at home.You get to control the ingredients, and you won't have the labor costs involved with restaurant meals.

Identify the foods you can prepare more cheaply at home.There's no need to buy containers of pre-made gelatin, pudding and tea when they're simple and inexpensive to make yourself.

Do a 5-minute inventory of your refrigerator at least twice a week.Find a use for everything before it goes bad. Toss wilting vegetables into a pot of soup or spaghetti sauce. Freeze leftovers for another day and use ripe bananas for banana bread or smoothies.

At the Grocery Store

Use coupons only for foods you normally buy.Find stores that host double- and triple-coupon days and shop during that time.

Invite the kids.Shop with your kids and show them how to choose healthy fruits and vegetables.

Don't shop when you're hungry — or when the kids are hungry. Have snacks before heading out to help you resist those impulse buys.

Don't reward with candy.Don't use candy as a reward for your kids' good behavior while shopping.

Limit the use of pre-packaged foods.Not only are individually wrapped products and convenience foods often higher in saturated fats and added sugars, but the convenience of grab-and-go foods like candy, chips, cookies and soft drinks often costs more.

Stock up.Buy extra canned and frozen goods, cereals and even meats and fish when they're on sale. Wrap meats in a freezer bag before freezing.

Buy generic.Store brands often are as good or better than the pricier name brand. Compare ingredients lists and Nutrition Facts panels.

Check unit prices or prices per serving.Search high and low because often the least expensive items are on the top and bottom shelves.

Use these high-nutrition, low-cost foods.Instead of expensive meats, try beans lentils, eggs, peanut butter, tofu and canned fish (salmon, tuna or crabmeat). You also can usually find good prices on grains including oats, brown rice and barley. Sweet and white potatoes are low-cost filling options. And, frozen fruit and vegetables are rich in nutrients and less expensive than some fresh counterparts.",planning

Vegetable gardening can help you save money on grocery bills and reduce your environmental impact. Some studies have shown that people who garden tend to eat more fruits and vegetables than those who don't garden, likely because gardening makes it easier to access fresh, healthy food. Use these simple steps to get started on a gardening adventure.

Gather Gardening Supplies

Gardening tools are essential for planting, watering, weeding and harvesting plants. Some basic tools include a shovel, hoe, rake, trowel, watering can and pruning shears.

Seeds are the starting point for any garden. When choosing seeds, consider the type of plants you want to grow, the climate you live in and the amount of space you have. Varieties include conventional, heirloom and organic seeds. As a beginner gardener, you may want to consider the most common type, conventional seeds, which are typically bred for high yields and resistance to pests and diseases. Organic seeds are grown without synthetic pesticides or fertilizers, while heirloom seeds are generally passed from generation to generation..

Seedlings are young plants that have been started indoors or in a greenhouse. They are a good option for gardeners who want to get a head start on the growing season. Seedlings can be purchased from a nursery or garden center, or you can start your own from seeds.

Healthy soil is important for growing healthy plants. Good soil should be loose, well-drained and rich in organic matter. You can improve the quality of soil by adding compost or other organic matter such as dried leaves, grass clippings or peat moss (hint: you can find it in home improvement stores). Lastly, consider having your soil tested. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends testing soil to make sure it is safe and does not contain high levels of lead.

Water also is essential for plant growth. It is important to use a safe water supply for watering fruit and vegetable plants to eliminate possible chemicals or pathogens. If you are unsure about the quality of your water, have it checked.

Fertilizer provides plants with nutrients to grow stronger. Varieties include organic, synthetic and soil that includes fertilizer. Some fertilizers provide immediate fertilization, while others may provide a “slow release.” Different plants require different types of fertilizer, so be sure to do your research and apply fertilizer as directed.

Compost is a natural fertilizer that is made from organic matter such as leaves, grass clippings and food scraps like banana peels and eggshells. Compost is a great option to consider, especially since it helps to reduce food waste.

As plants mature, support is needed for proper growth. Stakes or trellises provide support for climbing plants, such as cucumbers, and cages may be used for larger plants such as tomatoes.

Starting a Vegetable Garden

Before you start digging, choose a location that takes into consideration the size of the garden you want, the type of fruit or vegetable plants you want to grow and your climate. Plants that grow best in full sun need a location that provides at least 6 hours of sunlight daily. Think about the amount of time and money you want to invest in your garden based on your goals. You can start small and gradually increase the size of your garden as you gain experience or, if you want to grow a large garden or sell your produce, you will need to invest more time and money.

There are three main ways to grow a garden: in containers, in the ground or in raised beds. Each method has advantages and disadvantages.

Containersare a good option for gardeners with limited space and who don’t want the hassle of tilling soil, or who want to move their garden around. However, some plants may not grow as well in a small space, and they usually require more frequent watering and fertilizing.

The most traditional (and affordable) method, growingin the ground, is good for people who have a lot of space and want to grow a larger garden. However, it can be difficult to control weeds and pests.

Raised bedsare a good option for gardeners who do not have good soil in their yard (for example, clay or sand), do not have ground space to till for a garden, or who have limited mobility or difficulty bending over. One disadvantage is that materials to build a raised bed garden can be costly.

After choosing a location, sketch out your garden plan with the plants you want to grow. Consider these factors:

The amount of sunlight each area gets; some plants need full sun while others tolerate partial shade.

The condition of the soil and its pH level (a measure of how acidic the soil is); most vegetable and fruit plants grow best when pH is near neutral or between 5.5 to 7.

The depth of the soil; some plants, such as carrots and potatoes, need deep soil to grow properly.

The size of the plants and how much they may spread.

The amount of time you have to garden.

Your skill level; for example, a beginner gardener should start with easy-to-grow plants.

When plants will be ready to harvest to ensure you can use the ripe produce.

The best time to plant a garden varies depending on your climate. In general, you should plant when the soil is warm and the weather is consistently temperate. Consult theNational Gardening Association websitefor the best time to start planting your garden. Some vegetables tolerate cooler temperatures and may mature quicker, so they can be planted earlier and sometimes more than once in the same growing season.

Easiest Vegetables to Grow

These vegetables are relatively easy to grow from seed and can be harvested quickly. Plus, like all produce, they provide beneficial vitamins and minerals.

Lettuce

Spinach

Arugula

Radishes

Carrots

Beets

Green beans

Cucumbers

Melon

Zucchini

How to Start Seeds Indoors

Fill seed trays or pots with seed starting mix about 6 to 8 weeks before the last frost date.

Plant seeds according to package directions.

Cover seeds with a thin layer of soil.

Water lightly.

Place seed trays or pots in a warm, sunny spot. You also can use a grow light.

Keep soil moist but not soggy.

Once seedlings have sprouted, thin them out so there is only one seedling per pot or cell in the seed tray.

Continue to water and fertilize seedlings as needed.

Begin the process of acclimating the seedlings to the outdoors. Also known as “hardening off,” this allows plants to adjust to the weather, decreasing stress on the plant upon transplanting.

Tips for transplanting seedlings:

Choose a day when the weather is mild, between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit, and not windy.

Water the seedlings well before transplanting.

Dig a hole that is twice as wide as the root ball of the seedling.

Gently remove the seedling from the pot or seed tray and place it in the hole.

Fill the hole with soil and water the seedling well.

Apply mulch around the seedling to help retain moisture.

Basic Plant Care and Guidelines

A few plant practices can help ensure your garden is successful:

Allow for ample space during planting. If you place plants too close together, they will compete for resources and may not grow as well.

Water plants regularly, especially during hot, dry weather. Water at the base of plants and earlier in the day. Most plants need at least 1 inch of water per week but avoid overwatering, which can drown plants and cause root rot. Underwatering also can be an issue, causing dry leaves and wilting, or even death.

Fertilize plants regularly, if needed. Many plants need to be fertilized every few weeks, depending on the soil and type of fertilizer.

Clear weeds from your garden regularly. Weeds compete with plants for water, nutrients and sunlight.

Protect plants from pests and diseases, which can damage or even kill plants. Consider using a physical barrier such as row covers ─ a transparent or semi-transparent cloth that protects plants from wind and insects ─ or fencing to protect from deer and rabbits. You also can use natural pesticides, such as neem oil or insecticidal soap, for bugs that aren’t welcome in the garden. Beneficial bugs like ladybugs and praying mantises are helpful in keeping pests under control.

Harvest crops regularly, which encourages plants to produce more. If you wait too long to harvest, crops may become overripe and not taste as good.

With a little planning and effort, you can have a successful garden that provides fresh and healthy food.Looking for more resources to get started?

What to Look for in Yogurt,https://www.eatright.org/food/food-groups/dairy-and-alternatives/what-to-look-for-in-yogurt,"Reviewers:Academy Staff RDNs

Reviewed:September 26, 2023","What is cool, creamy and delicious? Yogurt! Even better, it has a place in a healthy eating routine for kids and adults. Yogurt is rich in protein and contains calcium and potassium. Some yogurts contain live, active bacteria cultures, as indicated on the label. These cultures, or probiotics, are considered ""good bacteria"" for the gut and can help maintain healthy digestive systems.

Yogurt comes in an array of flavors and styles. On a single trip to the supermarket, a shopper could easily find more than a dozen brands with multiple varieties of each.
Between low-fat, fat-free, fruited, flavored, plain, Greek and traditional — the choices can be overwhelming.

What Kind of Yogurt to Buy?

Whole Milk, Low-Fat or Fat-Free?TheDietary Guidelines for Americansrecommends keeping saturated fats to less than 10% of your daily calories each day. Choosing low-fat and fat-free yogurts can help you keep your daily intake within this range.

Fruited, Flavored or Plain?Added sugar is a common ingredient in fruited and flavored varieties of yogurt. Skip the added sugars by choosing plain yogurt and adding your own fruit or flavors such as cinnamon and vanilla. When you read the Nutrition Facts label on plain yogurt, you still will see that it lists ""sugar"" even though no sugar has been added. This is because even plain yogurt contains lactose, the naturally occurring sugar in milk.

Greek Yogurt or Traditional Yogurt?Greek yogurt is strained. This process makes it thicker, creamier and smoother than traditional yogurt. It also has double the protein of traditional yogurt, but less calcium. In both traditional and Greek yogurts, bacteria cultures help break down lactose, so yogurt is sometimes an easier-to-digest dairy food for those who are lactose intolerant. Greek yogurt has less lactose than traditional yogurt, so lactose-sensitive people may tolerate it even better than traditional yogurt.

Dairy or Plant-Based?Whether you cannot or choose not to consume dairy, the good news is there are loads of plant-based dairy alternatives on the market. Be sure to look for versions that are fortified with calcium and vitamin D. Fortified soy-based yogurt has the closest nutrition profile to dairy-based yogurt, while coconut milk and almond milk varieties are lower in protein.

I bought yogurt. Now what?

Dip it. Have fun in the kitchen with your family by using yogurt as a dip for a variety of different fruits. For a healthier alternative to a typical cream cheese-based fruit dip, stir together 1 cup nonfat Greek yogurt with 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.

Sweeten it.While all yogurt has some natural sugar, take care to choose yogurts that are low in added sugars or have no added sugars. TheDietary Guidelines for Americansrecommends limiting calories from added sugars to no more than 10% each day, which is equal to 200 calories for a 2,000-calorie diet. Fresh or frozen fruits are a great way to flavor yogurt while meeting additional nutrient needs.

Mix it.Start the morning off right by including yogurt at breakfast. Mix a 6-ounce container of low-fat yogurt with ½ cup sliced berries, a handful of granola and 2 tablespoons nuts for a quick and satisfying breakfast bowl.

Blend it.Create a calcium-packed snack using this yogurt smoothie recipe: one 6-ounce container low-fat yogurt, ¾ cup low-fat milk, ½ cup frozen strawberries, ½ cup frozen blueberries, 1 banana, 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Then, mix it all together using a blender. Depending on your family's tastes, you also can add in nut butter, vegetables, seeds or other nutritious ingredients.

Drink it.Make your own yogurt beverage by whisking together a 6-ounce container of low-fat strawberry-flavored yogurt and ¼ cup low-fat milk. Pour the mixture into cups and enjoy. If there's too much liquid, add more yogurt; if the mixture is too thick, add more milk.

Spoon it.Spoon in a delicious topping for your next taco night with plain yogurt. Use ½ cup plain low-fat Greek yogurt, 2 teaspoons taco seasoning and 1 teaspoon lime juice for a tasty alternative to sour cream. And that's not all: Plain yogurt is a versatile ingredient and often can be substituted for sour cream in recipes.

Dunk it.Dunk in the yogurt fun — and build kitchen skill confidence — with banana-yogurt-granola pops. Use half a banana with a popsicle stick placed in the bottom. Dunk the banana in low-fat yogurt, roll in granola and enjoy!

How Much of a Good Thing?

One cup of a dairy-based, fat-free or low-fat yogurt provides 30% to 45% of the daily value for calcium, so you can get a lot of nutritional bang for your buck. If you are using frozen yogurt, 1 cup provides about 10% of the daily value for calcium. Remember to look for fortified varieties if you're choosing plant-based alternatives. Fortified soy-based yogurt has the closest nutrition profile to dairy-based yogurt. Be sure to look for versions that are fortified with calcium and vitamin D.

One cup dairy-based yogurt or fortified soy-based yogurt counts as one of the three dairy servings recommended for children 9 years old through adulthood by MyPlate. For toddlers (12 to 23 months of age), 1⅔ to 2 cups of dairy are recommended daily. For children 2 to 3 years old, it is 2 to 2½ cups per day. For children 4 to 8 years old, 2½ cups per day of dairy is recommended, and 3 cups daily for children age 9 and older.",food-groups
Be a Savvy Farmers Market Shopper,https://www.eatright.org/food/planning/smart-shopping/be-a-savvy-farmers-market-shopper,"Contributors:Esther Ellis, MS, RDN, LDN

When it comes to buying produce, start small — buy salad ingredients to have at dinner each night and fruit for meals or snacks. Purchase vegetables you know how to prepare. Once you gain confidence, add new items. Search for staples you normally buy at the supermarket, such as bread, coffee, nuts, seeds or even soap.

Since items at a farmers market change often, bring a general shopping list rather than a specific one for the whole week — ingredients for salads and produce for side dishes that go well with planned dinners and entrées. To prevent rotting fruit in the fridge, estimate how many pieces of fruit you'll need for your lunches or snacks for the week.

Here are a few ideas on maximizing your trip and becoming a savvy farmers market shopper.

Don't be shy.The people selling products want to answer your questions. So, go ahead, and ask them. It’s the perfect time to find out what sunchokes are.

Do your homework.Find a market that's in a convenient location and has hours that fit your schedule so you can easily add a shopping trip into your weekly routine. Visitwww.localharvest.orgfor markets in your area.

Time your outing.If you can only go on weekends, get there early. Otherwise, go on a weekday during the middle of the day. The less traffic in the market, the more opportunities you'll have to get the best products and chat with vendors. If you're shopping on a budget, going at the end of the market day might enable you to get some deals and negotiate prices with the vendors.

Bring cash and reusable bags.While an increasing number of vendors take credit cards, some charge additional fees for convenience and others still rely on cash. Keep small bills on hand to make transactions easy. And remember to bring a sturdy, eco-friendly bag to carry your purchases home.

Become a gourmet.Ask the vendors for cooking suggestions; sometimes they provide recipes.Discover new recipe ideas, plus tips on selecting and storing fruits and vegetables.

Be flexible.Accept that produce will not look perfect. But, it has been grown locally and picked recently, which means it's packed with flavor and nutrients.

Reviewed:February 19, 2024","It's not just your hands that need washing before, during and after food preparation. To prevent food poisoning, it's also important to remember to wash your cutting boards. If not cleaned and maintained properly, cutting boards can hold harmful bacteria and spread food poisoning.

Follow these guidelines for cleaning and maintaining your cutting boards:

Always use a clean cutting board for food preparation.

After each use and before moving on to the next step while prepping food, clean cutting boards thoroughly in hot, soapy water, then rinse with water and air dry or pat dry with clean paper towels.

Plastic, glass, nonporous acrylic and solid wood cutting boards can be washed in a dishwasher (laminated boards may crack and split).

After cutting raw meat, poultry or seafood on a cutting board, clean it thoroughly with hot soapy water, then disinfect with chlorine bleach or other sanitizing solution and rinse with clean water.

To disinfect your cutting board, use a fresh solution of 1 tablespoon of unscented, liquid chlorine bleach per gallon of water. Flood the surface with the bleach solution and allow it to stand for several minutes. Rinse with water and air dry or pat dry with clean paper towels.

All cutting boards eventually wear out. Discard cutting boards that have become excessively worn or have hard-to-clean grooves. These grooves can hold harmful bacteria that even careful washing will not eliminate.

Be Careful With Cutting Boards

When juices from raw meats or germs from unclean objects accidentally touch cooked or ready-to-eat foods (such as fruits or salads), cross-contamination occurs. If not cleaned correctly, the board harbors harmful bacteria.

Acrylic, Glass, Marble, Plastic or Solid Wood?

You choose. Just follow these guidelines:

Use two cutting boards: one strictly to cut raw meat, poultry and seafood; the other for ready-to-eat foods, such as breads and vegetables.

Don't confuse them. Consider buying different colored cutting boards so it's easy to remember which one is for raw meat and which is for ready-to-eat foods.

Wash boards thoroughly in hot, soapy water after each use.

Discard old cutting boards that have cracks, crevices and excessive knife scars.",home-food-safety
